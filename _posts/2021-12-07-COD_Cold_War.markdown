## _Call of War: Black Duty Ops: The Big Cold One_

# Overview

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is the newest entry in the shambling, long since departed corpse of a franchise that is Call of Duty. It's been going 'strong' for nearly two decades, with a new entry every single year without fail for over a decade, no matter how borderline impossible this is for the developers that struggle to make a new and refreshing experience every year when Activision Blizzard can finally do as their master plan dictates and make Call of Duty into a live service experience with 'recurrant user spending opportunities' -- a fancy marketing rebrand of 'microtransactions' after the EA Battlefront 2 fuck up and the perception of the word 'microtransactions' amongst the gaming public became largely negative.

Now, having a series isn't necessarily a bad thing. Having many games that stick to the same general formula, themes, universe, story, style of gameplay, narrative techniques, and whatever else isn't automatically bad. That said, in the last few years, it's become increasingly obvious that the development studios under the enormous corporate bulk that is Activision Blizzard are increasingly struggling just to get these games out the door on the timeline they're given. With Treyarch's release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in 2018, they were _supposed_ to have until this year, 2021, for their next entry in the franchise, as the development cycle had changed to include Sledgehammer Games, Treyarch, and Infinity Ward in the list of lead studios, each one would head up a new entry in the franchise every three years in their respective series. The time crunch for Black Ops 4 was apparently so intense that they were forced to altogether abandon the singeplayer experience, opting for multiplayer, zombies, and their 'Black Out' battle royal mode, because that was all the rage at the time, effectively ending the canonical 'Black Ops' universe that started with Black Ops in 2010 and continued in Black Ops II and III in 2012 and 2015, respectively. Another thing to note is that Black Ops III picked up on the 'enhanced mobility' system from 2014's Advanced Warfare which was headed up by Sledgehammer Games, meaning that the player was able to perform a limited number of superhuman feats like double jumping and wall-running. It was never implemented to the same degree as something like a Titanfall, but the influence was clearly there and it was a controversial chapter in the history of the franchise, with many people either loving it or hating it.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, developed by Treyarch, was squirted out the door in a perfectly normal and fabulous 2020. I brought up Black Ops 4 and the development time crunch, because as I mentioned previously, 2020 was _supposed_ to be a new title from Sledgehammer Games. It was rumored sometime in May 2019 that Sledgehammer Games and Raven Software (another studio under Activison-Blizzard that is solely focused on providing development support to the 'major' studios, as well as developing spinoffs like mobile games as well as remasters) were having issues making nice-nice and this was apparently such a big disruption that whatever game this was supposed to be wasn't going to be done for a 2020 release target. And this predated COVID by almost a year, so if they had stayed the course there's no way in hell that thing would have made it out.

Anyways, the next Call of Duty game remained in limbo for far longer than the next entry to a series will typically do after the release of the previous entry. Generally speaking, a Call of Duty game will be released in the October-November timeframe, with the following game announced sometime the following May. It wasn't until August 4, 2020 that we knew a new Call of Duty game was indeed coming in 2020, but that it would be co-headed by Treyarch and Raven Software, their first step up to the big leagues. Sort of. In order to launch the game given their development window, Raven Software assumed command of the singleplayer campaign while Treyarch took multiplayer and zombies. For better or worse, the game launched as announced on November 13th, 2020 with seemingly no delays due to COVID-19 slowing development, and honestly, I'll hand it to the teams at Treyarch, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Beenox, High Moon Studios, Blizzard, and to a very lesser degree, the corporate fuck-weasles at Activision for managing to achieve such a feat of rush-developing a game in a year and a half, when slightly under half of your development time came during the end of the world and the imminent collapse of society, because that's about all the praise they're really going to get from me.

Speaking of the imminent collapse of society, the singleplayer campaign is all about the imminent collapse of one of two societies: either the West or the Soviets. Presumably you could call them the East but I don't know if anyone ever did that.

# ~~Singleplayer~~ Main Menu and Some Technical... Stuff

We interrupt this narrative exploration of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War to bring you a review of the main menu of the aforementioned. This may seem strange to you, however, rest assured this is a very valid point to review as A) the main menu blows fucking chunks and B) you'll be spending at least some amount of time during your Black War Cold Ops career on said chunk-blowing menu.

![](https://i.imgur.com/4b4Ltu7.jpg)

So why is the main menu so bad? Well for one thing, there's three fuckin' games on it. I open the Battle.net client, I click that I want to play Call of Duty Blahblah Subtitles, it loads, and then it asks me if I want to play Jumbled Subtitle, Warzone, or the last game in the series that's already dead and everyone has already forgotten about. For Cold War and Modern Warfare, when you hover over one of their banners it will then display buttons for their three respective modes. Campaign, Multiplayer, and one of zombies/spec ops. If you go over to the Modern Warfare banner and hit campaign, it then just closes Cold War, opens the Battle.net launcher, and then would launch Call of Duty Warzone; because apparently they just decided to roll Modern Warfare and Warzone into a single game after the release of Cold War, and Warzone is free but Modern Warfare isn't... So I'm not sure what the fuck you do if you want to play Modern Warfare and you haven't already purchased it. I'm assuming that it's still in the store and then... I don't know how they communicate to you that you've purchased Modern Warfare when it's bundled under the umbrella of a different game entirely. It's just really fucking stupid and I absolutely detest it. Of the entire menu, 66% of the screen is effectively wasted space if you only want to play the game that you actually pushed the button to state your intent to play.

I'm assuming that this isn't present on consoles, and is a nifty PC-exclusive 'feature'. Speaking of Warzone, that's kind of another clusterbomb of fuck that maybe I'll come back to, but maybe not [EDITOR'S NOTE: not]. As for spending time on the main menu that I'm ever so fond of, you have to wait for it to compile shaders for all three modes after every update, just like you did with Modern Warfare. I understand the performance reasons for compiling shaders to use during the game, and I understand the reason that it will be offloaded to the client-side (at least on PC where all hardware and software configurations are different and therefore a pre-compiled shader might not work that well), but it's still just not a great experience for the user to spend potentially hours downloading the game and then their first ten to twenty minutes to be spent sitting in the menu waiting for the game to be actually playable. Additionally, this has to be done _every time the game has an update_, which means you're probably going to be spending ten to twenty minutes compiling shaders a decent number of times. If you play the game infrequently like I did with Modern Warfare, you'll pay that tax _every_ time you play the game. After downloading 200 GB of updates, of course. Speaking of downloading, surprisingly the game is only 92 GB (currently) compared to like 130 GB at launch of Modern Warfare which proceeded to balloon to over 230 GB _on disk_ at the release of Cold War. Speaking of Cold War, I'm reviewing this game, which takes place during the Cold War. This is most notable in the singleplayer campaign mode. Which has a story that takes place during the alleged Cold War. And since this is a review, I will now review that.

# Singleplayer (really this time)

## Story

In this part, I'm going to try and keep it strictly focused on the overall story that is presented, then talking about the gameplay separately. The game officially has 16 missions, but in reality it's 15, as the last two are reserved for one of two endings. Spoilers for the story, by the way. Additionally, some of the things listed as missions aren't actually really missions, so I would say more like 10 to 12. Additionally, there are two optional side missions. From what little I paid attention to this game during the marketing period, they were talking about a 'choices matter, branching campaign' that was more open and free than previous Call of Duty games. Technically, that's true, and if I was a marketing scumbag I would say something along the lines of "This game has at least ten distinct endings." which is again, technically true. In reality though, that number hovers somewhere in the neighborhood of... Two. We'll get back to this.

The first mission is a pretty typical cold-open to a Call of Duty game, where they reused basically the same technique that Black Ops (2010) used to open -- you're in a bar and you hear some voices talking about the upcoming undercover operation while your screen is black, then a lighter flicks open and your screen is illuminated solely by the fire dancing on the tip of the lighter to light a death stick, then the world fades in and the game starts. It was an interesting callback to the first game in the series, which is still canonical to Black Ops Cold War, as is referenced a few more times during the campaign, but I wonder how many people actually picked up on that fact. Instead of being in Cuba about to launch the Bay of Pigs and assassinate Fidel Castro, you're in Amsterdam about to track down some ethnic-sounding baddies -- Qasim Javadi and Arash Kadivar. I don't even know how to pronounce that gibberish. Surely they must be evil.

"Mission 2" is just an introduction to the CIA safehouse in Berlin, and isn't really what I would consider to be a mission. It introduces you to the evidence board which is a neat little way of having the player interact with the different story missions. To begin a mission, you'll use the evidence board where there will be a small briefing and then you launch the mission. This is somewhat similar to what Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare did, where the player was free to select their next mission, with several side missions and usually one 'main story' mission available at any given time. In Black Ops Cold War, however, there's only actually two side missions, and we can come back to those.

Then you're off to Vietnam, where you start out with a chopper gunner sequence, then on the ground to steal some intel from a 'secret' Soviet outpost nestled in a small village, then you get to fly the helicopter back down the river à la _Payback_ from Black Ops where Mason and Woods steal a hind and fly it down a river while blowing things up. It's basically the same mission here but with a different helicopter. You then land your helicopter at an American firebase that was under heavy assault and on the verge of being overrun atop a hill, where a soldier will then ask Adler, the MACV-SOG operative embedded with a Marine regiment to look for Soviet presence in Vietnam, to confirm his identity before motioning to some guys to bring over the nuke.

That's right.

The mission is about a heliborne fleet that is sent to recover a nuke from an American firebase that's about to be overrun. This may leave you with some questions like: _Why does a firebase in enemy territory have a nuke? Why are they storing it literally feet from the front gate that the enemies are about to break through? Why are they storing this nuke at a firebase where the planes that would be used to drop said nuke are distinctly unable to land? How did it even get there, and why?_ and potentially many more. These are all very valid questions. They are not answered and this whole scenario makes no fucking sense what-so-ever. They chuck the nuke on the chopper, it's basically a trash can with some nuclear symbols painted on the side, and you peace the fuck out, presumably leaving everyone else at the firebase to die when the VC come back. Unfortunately and very predictably, the helicopter next to you is shot down, which crashes into yours which forces it to the ground where you're then about to be overrun again while desperately guarding the nuke. There's a very near friendly-fire incident with a napalm strike, but the mission ends and everything is A-okay.

In the next mission, you infiltrate East Berlin to capture a Russian mobster operating in Berlin because he has ties to the mysterious Perseus. I forgot, but by the way, the plot of this game is to once again capture or kill the Russian agent known as Perseus, based on the Russian spy of the same name that allegedly was able to infiltrate the highest levels of the US intelligence community, and steal details of the Manhattan Project from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. In the real world, it is seemingly now agreed upon that Perseus never existed and was a fabrication of Soviet intelligence in order to drive paranoia in the US amongst various national security agencies. In the universe of BO: CW, Perseus was confirmed to have existed and was never confirmed killed or captured while he was active during the period of 1944-1960 something. Now, in 1981, he is active once more and President Reagan has charged CIA Clandestine Special Agent Russel Adler with eliminating Perseus. So back to East Berlin, you have to sneak through the streets, avoiding Stasi as you trail a German messenger for the Russian mobster. You meet a CIA contact in a bar while attempting to listen to the meeting between the two, but the Russian never shows, instead sending someone to inform the messenger that he has be tailed before the Stasi move in. The German contact stays behind as you slip out the bathroom and then meet up with the rest of the CIA team. You then infiltrate the messenger's apartment to plant a tracker in his briefcase, where you found the bound German lady and get pistol-whipped by the dude before waking up in a warehouse where blah blah the rest of the team bursts in from the skylight and does some shooting and you capture the guy. You're then given the choice of killing him or capturing him.

Next you creep through the woods to find a massive Soviet building in the Ukraine with Woods, which you stealthily infiltrate only to eventually find yourself in a giant, life-sized mock up of Anytown, USA, which is used by Spetsnaz for training and live-fire drills of a hypothetical Russian invasion of the United States. You proceed to make the live-fire slightly more live than originally intended and blast your way out and into the next mission, after discovering that Perseus has infiltrated Operation Greenlight. Operation Greenlight is basically the United States pulling a Belka and planting neutron bombs in all the major European cities to detonate in the event of a Soviet invasion.

In mission 7, _Echoes of a Cold War_, you return to the Mount Yamantau facility in the Ural Mountains, which featured in _WMD_ in Black Ops, where a CIA detachment guided by an SR-71 infiltrated and destroyed the facility which was being used to weaponize Nova 6. In BO: CW, the Russians have returned to the long abandoned and decrepit, mostly destroyed facility teeming with frozen corpses with the intention of recovering the computer mainframe which they believe has some useful information of some kind on it. You blast your way into and out of the facility with the help of Dimitri Belikov, a KGB double-agent, and his Hind, in exchange for a Cubs baseball hat. Yes, I'm serious. You lift the mainframe out, but unfortunately, the mainframe has already been wiped by Perseus, the target information suspected to be a list of Soviet sleeper agents in the United States, left-over from the Nova 6 program. Instead, you have to infiltrate the Lubyanka Building, the KGB headquarters, to retrieve the list from a high-security vault in a bunker under the building. The Soviets have determined that there is a mole in the KGB and are working to find them, as in the first half of this mission you play as Belikov, who helps Bell and Adler infiltrate the building and provides them with a key to the high-security bunker. Unfortunately, the mole-hunting squad has taken away the keys from everyone save for one General Charkov. You use one of five methods to recover his key as Belikov and go do the thing. Mission kind of goes tits up and you blast your way out of the Lubyanka Building in a juggernaut suit with a floppy drive with the list of sleeper agents in hand. By the way, Imran Zakhaev is in charge of the mole investigation, making this game canon to probably 2019 Modern Warfare and the universe. Zakhaev was the main antagonist in a much better game of the same name, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Another callback for long-time fans of the series that almost nobody probably actually got. Kravchenko from Black Ops (2010) also makes a cameo.

Bell is the player character, by the way. Forgot about that to. More on that later and in the gameplay section.

You find out one of the sleeper agents has fled to Cuba, and also that one of the Project Greenlight nukes has disappeared. The CIA conducts a surprise raid of the facility in Cuba only to find that Perseus is gone and that he's executed most of the scientists. The sleeper agent is bleeding out on the floor but is alive enough to tell Helen Park (an MI6 person who was requested for the CIA team to hunt down Perseus) that Perseus forced the scientists to reverse engineer the Project Greenlight nuke in order to figure out the detonation codes. Perseus can now detonate _all_ of the Project Greenlight nukes if he can broadcast the launch sequence from somewhere.

But where could that possibly be?

Well, Bell knows. Bell is the player character, at the beginning of the game, you can choose a name for them, as well as gender, skin-type, and one of three back-stories. CIA, MI6, or KGB. You also choose two 'psychological profiles' that affect the gameplay in some way, so more about those later. But _gasp_, Bell wasn't real at all! The Vietnam memories were actually memories that were implanted in him by a super secret CIA project called Project MKUltra, which was a real, highly unethical, and definitely illegal CIA project to research various forms of mind control and psychological torture. Turns out that Bell was actually an associate of Arash Kadivar from mission one, and one of the two people in the truck that Arash shoots before boarding the plane as Mason, Woods, and Adler watched before attacking. Bell was recovered, and tortured for information which didn't work, so they instead implant memories, using Adler's time in Vietnam as a template, in the hopes that eventually some of his previous memories would resurface and he would disclose information about Perseus.

This is all revealed after an interesting level where Adler reads scenario documents, attempting to narrate Bell through his time in Vietnam, which of course never actually happened, convincing Bell that he was sent to find a secret bunker where he found Perseus. The hope here being that Bell will then either disclose the identity or location of Perseus. At this point, it becomes clear to the player that Perseus is not an individual, but an organization acting without the authority of the Soviet government. This is the best mission in the game, and is genuinely quite interesting from a narrative, visual, and gameplay perspective, but is impossible to describe well in writing, so I would recommend that you go watch a playthrough of Missions 12, 13, and 14, which are _Interrogation, Break on Through,_ and _Identity Crisis_. Again, they're separated into three missions but they're mostly one mission. After flashback and murky memories, you have the location of 'Perseus' and are given the option to tell the location to Adler, or to lie and give him a false location.

The game presents several 'choices' to the player, but this one is really the only one that actually has a meaningful impact on the story overall. If you tell him the true location, you're off to some islands in the arctic circle to stop the transmission, if you lie and tell him the false location, you'll then setup an ambush by walking over to a radio that has apparently just been chilling in the hideout for months with Comrade Private Ivan just waiting for someone to say the words and tell him that the CIA team will be brought to Duga, near the giant radar array. A nice little point of attention to details here is that as soon as you lie, and if you have subtitles enabled, all the CIA team subtitles will switch to red and Soviet ones become blue, to indicate that you have now changed sides.

If you chose the American ending, you will rock up on the island, destroy the AA guns, allowing for American bombers to carpet bomb the shit out of the three giant radars on the island, preventing the codes from being broadcast and thus saving the day. Bell is uncovered from the rubble by Woods, Mason and Adler. Adler then leads Bell off to a small cliff-side overlooking the sea, where he congratulates Bell on his heroism in siding with the CIA despite everything for the sake of saving the world. He then assures Bell that it was all for the greater good calls him a hero, and commending him on his sacrifice, asks him to make one more, assuring Bell it was never personal before he turns with his pistol drawn and leveled towards Bell. Bell does the same, a gun goes off, and cut to black for credits.

In the Russian ending, Bell brings the team to Duga, where they find nothing. Bell then signals the ambush as Soviet forces pour out of the trees, surrounding and quickly dispatching the American strike force. The player is charge with killing the surviving members of the team, Adler, Mason, Woods, and one of/neither of Lazar and Park depending on who they chose to save at the end of the Cuban raid. After dispatching Adler, the guy who appeared to be Perseus during some of the flashback cutscenes welcomes Bell back and hands him a radio, allowing him to do the honors and single for the broadcast of the Project Greenlight codes. The nukes detonate, millions die, and the US is squarely to blame. Reagan orders all information related to Project Greenlight to be destroyed and buried. A mysterious CIA person known as Black, with whom Hudson (CIA agent) converses during some cutscenes in the game assures him the cover-up is already under way.

As for the rest of the supposed choices and side-missions, they really only come into play in the sequence between the end of the mission and the actual credits, which is just some narration and visuals which wraps up lose ends. This dialogue changes based on if the side missions were completed and how, and the fates of a few different characters depending on the choices that were made. Come to think of it, in the American ending it goes Mission, then this part, then Adler 'Nothing personal, kid'-ing Bell. In the Russian ending, this part is done by the Perseus figurehead guy.

This may seem like a long summary of the story, and it kind of is for a review, but it's necessary to at least have a vague overall understanding of the plot-points in order for me to make my points. I left out a lot about most of the characters and only gave the main ideas, because the rest doesn't really matter that much. Whenever the player is given a choice that isn't the final Lie versus Truth, it only really affects the wrap-up dialogue after the game has technically ended, except in the case of saving Lazar or Park in Cuba after a sky-hook goes slightly wrong. In this case, the only thing that changes is which one of them is present for the last three 'missions', but the only real affect this has is also on a few lines of dialogue. As for the two optional side missions, they also only affect this end dialogue. They're structured in such a way that they're there starting with mission one, but then you're actively discouraged from actually playing them, because you have to look for pieces of evidence in the other missions. Right before you depart for Cuba, you're warned that after that mission you no longer have access to the evidence board, and therefore are no longer able to play the side missions.

I think this was an interesting idea with a somewhat botched execution. The pieces of evidence are not obvious and very obscure if you do happen to stumble across one of them, and they're needed because in one of the side missions, you have an encrypted floppy that you have to decrypt so you can not only bring down a rogue CIA double-agent, but also the spy network he established in the United States. If you go to play the mission without decrypting the floppy, the game gives you a warning, telling you that you should really decrypt the floppy first or else the spy network will remain intact. This is similar with the other side mission, only you instead have to discern three suspects from a list of eight before doing whatever that mission was, with the same warning that you should find all the evidence first. If the evidence isn't something you're going to naturally stumble upon, and it isn't, it's most likely that you just won't play these missions, which is exactly what happened to me. I stumbled across one evidence before hitting the warning about losing access to them, and was no interested in going back to replay missions and sweep through them with a fine-tooth comb to find these things to play the missions properly, especially when you're not given any indication as to which missions have things in them. Frankly, it just wasn't worth that effort and I didn't really care that much. I can guarantee you that, at the end of the day, they're probably still just Call of Duty missions anyways.

Overall, the story is... Fine. For basically the entire thing up until Mission 12, it is a very Call of Duty story where it is basically just designed to move you from shooting-gallery to shooting-gallery, with some different scenery around the targets. They tried to make it a little bit more nuanced and capture that Cold War era feeling of paranoia and distrust when Hudson, a CIA agent that is a minor character in Black Ops is aware of all of the Project Greenlight stuff before Adler's team is made aware of it officially, which results in some tension and is even framed in the context that Hudson could potentially be a double-agent. This is seen again in the effort to infiltrate the Lubyanka Building with the help of a double-agent whose cover is about to be blown. While this seems to be a major theme, it doesn't come off as much more than a token inclusion and attempt at complex narrative storytelling which falls a bit flat.

My main point of the story review is that the entire story is just a rehash of 2010's Call of Duty Black Ops, in a similar way to how Star Wars Episode 7 is actually just a thinly disguised retelling of Episode 4.

For those who don't remember, in Black Ops the CIA chases the Russian boogeyman around various locations, while the Soviets have a dangerous new doomsday weapon that will explode and wipe out all the major cities in America. They try everything, but they can't catch the final baddy. Their last hope is Mason, a SOG operative captured after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and assassination of Castro, before he's turned over to the Russians. He's brought to a prison/work camp called Vorkuta where he's then programmed as a sleeper agent, it's alluded to he's supposed to work alongside Lee Harvey Oswald to assassinate JFK. The CIA tries to torture the information out of him, then forces him to relive various memories in the hope that he will remember and disclose the location of the broadcast array that will signal the sleeper agents around the US to set and detonate the Nova 6 bombs so it can be destroyed.

In Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, the CIA chases the Russian boogeyman around various locations, while the Soviets have a dangerous new doomsday weapon that will explode and wipe out all the major cities in Europe. They try everything, but they can't catch the final baddy. Their last hope is Bell, a captured Soviet/Perseus operative. The CIA tries to torture the information out of him, then forces him to relieve various (faked) memories in the hope that he will remember and disclose the location of the broadcast array that will signal the detonation of Project Greenlight so it can be destroyed.

Sound familiar?

If you take this two games, boil them down to their simplest forms, and were just a wee bit vague, you could write an identical summary that describes both games. I don't have any strong opinions about this being a good or a bad thing, but between the two, Call of Duty: Black Ops is the better game. The storytelling was better, the music was better, and the story was much more engaging and intriguing. There are many different hints given throughout the runtime of Black Ops that indicate to someone paying a sufficient amount of attention that something isn't quite right and that reality and what you're seeing might not be perfectly aligned. In Cold War, it's a very bland, straightforward, cliche, and by-the-books story until it gets interesting for the second to last mission. To me, the second to last mission, which I mentioned above as being 12-14, is the part of the game where I was actually engaged with and interested in the story. Black Ops does basically the same thing, but everything in the lead-up to the grand reveal is more interesting than the copy-cat in Cold War.

Overall, I don't have much more to say. The story is Black Ops again but worse, is only interesting for one mission, and is a thoroughly forgettable excuse to move the player around to tell them to shoot things, which is a common theme of Call of Duty stories, but this one fails to adequately disguise that fact, something that the Call of Duty games of decades passed were able to do to much greater success.

## Gameplay

It should come as no surprise that a Call of Duty game is a Call of Duty game. If you've played a Call of Duty game before, you've basically played this one. You shoot things, there's a chopper gunner level, you shoot at things from a turret in a car as you ram through things, you fly a helicopter, there's a short AC-130 segment, and you shoot things. Much wow, very startle.

The exception here is that Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is determined to be a stealth-lite experience, with a greater number and emphasis on stealth missions than prior entries in the series. Unlike early games, these segments are no longer guided. You're dropped in an area and told what to do while avoiding the enemies, in a way that feels kind of like a very watered-down Metal Gear Solid type experience. You're given an optional objective and you just kind of go for it. It's free and open-ended compared to the usually very linear and narrow style of most Call of Duty missions, and is an interesting attempt at keeping it fresh and varied. There's two of these kinds of missions, and then two more traditional CoD stealth missions where you're either following someone else or only have to think for yourself enough to avoid the enemies walking around. I'm not particularly a fan of stealth games, so I wasn't huge on these missions, but it is something different at least.

There is one other somewhat notable change which is in the inclusion of "character creation." As I mentioned before, you get to chose like five things and you never actually see the character. The only thing that really matters here being the psychological profiles, which do have a tangible affect on gameplay. Some of them make you reload faster, do more damage, run faster, etc. You get to pick two. I went with the one that halved reload time and the other that increased bullet damage by 25%.

Other than that, there really isn't much to say. You shoot things until they're dead and that's basically that. I don't think there's anything wrong with a series sticking to its identity and not trying to change something for the sake of doing so, and here they've definitely made a Call of Duty game. It is exactly what I expected it to be and that's pretty much fine.

### Visuals and More Technical

Visually, running on a top-of-the-line gaming computer (Ryzen 9 5950X and RTX 3090) on the Ultra preset which includes all Ray Tracing options set to Ultra with Nvidia DLSS set to performance mode on a 32:9 5120x1440p monitor, the game looks really good. So good that my dad, who hasn't played a video game since probably 1982, was able to appreciate how good it looked as I crawled through a crumbling tunnel on a cliff side underneath an abandoned Soviet radar station, with traced-rays streaming in through the holes in the ceiling. It looks as good as any other big-budget AAA game would look on the hardware, there's not a ton to say here as this isn't really a review about my computer or the hardware inside of it. It ran at about 60-120 FPS depending on the exact scene, spending most of the time in the neighborhood of 100 FPS. I turned off DLSS just to see what happened and it dipped to about 40-55 FPS. I didn't spend a ton of time looking in to it and really comparing some side-by-sides, but the general consensus is that DLSS is good now and I didn't notice any loss in clarity or sharpness. The game does support 32:9 and 21:9 aspect ratios, helpfully moving HUD elements in towards the middle of the screen instead of making you gaze off into Narnia to see your ammo count or whatever, but there was a small bug where sometimes enemies would pop or disappear and reappear at the very edges of the frame, specifically in cutscenes. They all seem to be done in-engine, so I think the idea here is that someone walks out of frame and then back in on a normal 16:9 display, but when you have that extra peripheral, they're in view the whole time so they sort of teleport or snap around. It happened a few times, and overall isn't a huge deal.

Despite their flaws, Call of Duty games are generally quite polished, especially in comparison to the lamentable state that some other AAA games will launch in, and there were no major bugs or technical issues to speak of. The only this is that sometimes the hitbox to press 'F' to interact with things would be wonky and kind of require you to reposition a few times in order to find it.

The voice acting in this game isn't very good. Honestly, it's kind of surprising because that's not really a problem in any other CoD game that I've played. There have been some all-start Hollywood casts and some WHOMEGALULs, but it's usually fine. For Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, for what I can determine to be no discernible reason, they elected not to bring back James C. Burns who played Frank Woods for Black Ops 1-4, and instead replace him with someone, Frankly (haha), worse. James C. Burns' performance was basically just him reading his lines in his natural voice, from what I can tell, the new guy is trying really, really, really hard to do an _impression_ of James C. Burns, and kind of fails miserably. The same is true for Alex Mason, Sam Worthington is out, and a new guy is brought in to do his best impression of Sam Worthington, again with little success. To round out the returning characters, Hudson is fine. Hudson has had a different voice actor in every game he's appeared in, so it's not a huge deal here, and the guy who plays him in Cold War does a perfectly adequate gruff CIA man voice.

The new cast is more or less fine, but I wonder why they didn't bring back the other two who reprised their roles as recently as 2018. In the case of James C. Burns, it seems like he was very willing and interested in playing Woods again, but seemingly it was decided that he... Wouldn't. Also Woods is just kind of annoying in this game. He has a bunch of shitty one-liners that are just not very good. Thankfully Woods and Mason aren't in this game a ton.

Now on to music. Oh, wait. I just updated the game so now we have to wait for shaders to compile again.

## Music

Jack Wall returns as the lead composer again. He usually works on Treyarch games it would seem, and has been around since Black Ops II. I'm someone who is generally very sensitive to music, and it's... fine, I guess. Really good music can absolutely make or break an entire show, movie, or game for me. Generally, I'll notice music that's either really bad, or really good. This falls somewhere right in the middle, firmly into the "Yeah, it had music... I think..." category, which to me is kind of bad. There was nothing in particular that stands out to me at all. The main menu theme with its Russian chanting is pretty good which is good because you'll hear it an awful lot as you watch the compiling shaders bar, same with the themes for multiplayer and zombies, my favorite here being the zombies theme song in which Kevin Sherwood kind of revisits his signature 'Damned' piano theme song from Black Ops' zombies mode with "Echoes of the Damned". Overall, falls well short of the gold standard that is and was Modern Warfare 2. That said, that game had some tracks by Hans Zimmer so it wins by default and is kind of cheating.

# Multiplayer

It should come as no surprise that a Call of Duty game is a Call of Duty game. The multiplayer is exactly what you can and should expect from your Call of Duty multiplayer experience. There are people and you shoot them. Personally, I think the Operators thing is dumb as shit where they have five to ten different Operators that you pick from, which no longer have any kind of unique ability and it is purely cosmetic. In my opinion, there was nothing wrong with having generic mil-sim people running around shooting each other, and having the Operators adds literally nothing to the experience.

As for the game itself, in my first six games I placed top of the leaderboard in all but one, with all of the game being positive. I know CoD implements a skill-based matchmaking system, which has somehow been controversial as people only want to play games against people significantly worse than them for some reason. Compared to Overwatch, my multiplayer game of choice, Call of Duty is honestly kind of easy. There's no shields, no healing, nobody flying around in the fucking sky, no stuns, you just shoot at people and they die*. I've definitely seen the SBMM at work, my first game was against a bunch of people who were blatantly... Not good. They had no awareness and no aim, and kind of just ran in a straight line until they died, only really being able to kill me due to lag or me being surrounded on multiple sides. Maybe they were console players. The next game, they were definitely *better\* with much higher awareness, but I was still pretty dominant. Either the SBMM is much looser or slower than I'm used to, or I'm an absolutely cracked out of my mind freak of nature. Definitely one of those.

\*Unless they don't.

Speaking of lag, no, I'm not just blaming my deaths on lag. I have seen it measured that, among multiplayer games, Overwatch is consistently first or second best in terms of server responsiveness and latency compensation. Call of Duty is consistently sucking dicks towards last place. It shows. There are times, even in just five games, when a death is _blatantly_ caused by 'lag', or a difference in what I saw versus my opponent. There are times that I have rounded a corner and had fractions of a second to react and kill an enemy, so I raise my gun and shoot and no hits register, and suddenly I'm dead. On their screen I rounded the corner running in a straight line with my head down and they leisurely shoot me. I'm on their screen for over a second and a half, and they're on mine for probably less than one. It's not always isolated, this is a pretty consistent facet of the experience, and has been a staple of the franchise for a long, long time. Honestly, it's baffling how they haven't ironed this shit out when they _have_ the same engineers that developed the netcode for Overwatch in the same company.

It can be frustrating, it can be fun. It's CoD multiplayer.

I haven't played all of the maps, they feel overall better than the 'realistic' maps of Modern Warfare which were just way too big and felt awful to play at times, with camping in the same spot encouraged making it almost impossible to play a more fast-paced, flanking/run-and-gun play-style that I usually go for. They've also walked back some of the "innovations" of Modern Warfare, moving the red dots for enemies back onto the minimap instead of in the compass which nobody used. The gunsmith is still present and kind of overwhelming at times, with an interface that I would generously describe as a 'lose-lose' situation. The Battle Pass monetization model makes a return. I don't really have enough room left for an entire soapbox rant about the video games industry, but I will take the Battle Pass over lootboxes or other predatory microtransactions. It also means that future content like maps and zombies maps are free instead of $15 for another 4 multiplayer maps and 1 zombies map like previous games. Frankly, I might just be too old that I don't actually understand the Battle Pass or how it really works, and buying it clearly gives you a competitive advantage over someone that doesn't, so I still don't really like it, but I will at least grant that it's... Better than previous methods.

# Zombies

I don't have a ton to say about zombies. In Black Ops, it might have been my favorite mode, with Kino Der Toten and Ascension being overall pretty fantastic maps for the mode. It was all downhill from there, and as zombies modes have become more involved, more complex, and the story being moved from a really small thing in the background to something that was brought to the fore-front where casual players couldn't miss it, I found myself enjoying the experience less and less. I liked the simple days of zombies, where there were four perks on the map, the map was relatively small, and there were two different kinds of rounds with very simple mechanics, where the story of zombies modes were reserved for obscure things on the ground, messages on the wall, voice lines, and some audio logs that could be found on certain maps.

Cold War returns with the futuristic type of zombies that I can't say that I'm a fan of, by bringing back the OG zombies map in Nacht Der Untoten, but this time you can walk outside, and also there's a bunker with a whole bunch of weird machines connecting it to the alternate universe Dark Aether... Or something. The core experience is still kind of there, but there's so much extraneous shit on top of it that you're kind of forced to engage with if you actually want to go for any kind of high round run, or you just want to have the most effective combination of weapons and perks. I don't really have much else to say. It's there, it's fine. It's not really for me anymore, maybe it would be better playing with someone else. As for me, my days of rushing home from school to play a few rounds of Ascension with my friends are long gone and they're not coming back.

# Conclusion

Should you buy Call of War: Black Duty Ops: The Big Cold One?

Well, I highly doubt this review, two months late, is going to influence any purchases. I would say probably not. In my opinion, for what I look for in a video game, Call of Duty games are no longer worth their asking price for what I want to play. You might now wonder why I bought this then. The answer being that technically, I didn't. It was free with my purchase of a graphics card, so I redeemed it and played it. For me, the price is right to at least download it and give it a try. I would say the campaign is worth about $10, and the multiplayer is a perfectly serviceable Call of Duty multiplayer mode if you're into that sort of thing, with zombies mode thrown in as a bonus because all CoD games are required to have three modes.

There's just not much more to say about that. It's the product of hyper focus-tested development that has been distilled down into the perfect recipe for a commercial success with the least amount of innovation required that can be slapped together every year and pushed out the door for another $3 billion straight into the pockets of the slimy fucksticks at Activision Blizzard. It is what it is. There's nothing inherently bad with that, just as there's nothing inherently good with that. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is in the quantum superposition of ratings. It is neither good nor bad, it simply is. It is inevitable and it is eternal.

Shadow Reviews Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War: 5/10

Perfectly mediocre.
