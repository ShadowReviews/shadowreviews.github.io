# Overview

World's #1 Overwatch League Fan Shadow here to guide you through season four of the Overwatch League, which starts Friday April 16th at 2:30pm central with the Houston Outlaws taking on the Dallas Fuel in the Battle for Texas, followed by an epic clash between two superteams in the California Cup as the Los Angeles Gladiators take on the reigning Overwatch League Champions in the San Francisco Shock. First I'll be quickly walking through my thoughts on the change to this year's league format, as well as the roster for EVERY SINGLE TEAM IN THE LEAGUE!!

The Valiant fucking suck. Fuck Immortals Gaming Club. That's my thought on them.

<br>

# Season Format

After being forced to hastily adapt to our "new normal world" or brave new world or whatever in March last year with only a week off, Overwatch League Season 3 struggled initially. After the death of the Homestand model after a mere four(ish) weeks and a few pretty successful events in Boston, Dallas, Washington D.C., and New York, April was kind of a slog. Games were played, the casters casted at odd hours and with dwindling energy through various technical issues as various teams went missing for weeks on end as their parent organizations relocated them as the world continued to shut down and society began to finally collapse.

Then in late April, the League announced the first ever May Melee, a two week 'regular season' followed by a single elimination tournament bracket, with 13 teams competing in North America and the other 7 in APAC. It was massively successful and played a huge part in turning the league around as production slowly got a bit better as they had more time and experience working from home and injected a lot of life and purpose into the season when they had just been playing games for a few weeks with none of that previously.

The format continued, with the Summer Showdown in the first week of July and the Countdown Cup in August, topping off with two double elimination regional tournament brackets to determine the Final Four teams that would compete in the Overwatch League 2020 Playoffs. Two teams -- the San Francisco Shock and Philadelphia Fusion advanced and went to Korea to play against the Shanghai Dragons and Seoul Dynasty from the APAC tournament, with SFS taking the back to back Grand Finals victory.

This year, with online play planned from the start and many months to do so thanks to the decision to delay the start of the season from February to mid-April, the structure of the season is much more solid.

This year, the season is divided into four tournaments -- the May Melee in early May, June Joust in June, Summer Showdown in mid July, and Countdown Cup in late August. Each tournament is proceeded by three "regular season" weeks. Each team is guaranteed to play a total of 16 matches this season, down from 27 last year. Both the June Joust and Countdown cup will be played with hero pools, which includes all the regular season games and the actual tournament. This is an improvement over last year where the regular season games from all three tournaments had hero pools, but then the actual tournament matches didn't, which didn't make a ton of sense. Hero pools are basically the league randomly picking two damage, and one tank and support hero that will be banned an unavailable for play, basically in order to force the professional players to switch up the meta to prevent it from stagnating.

For each tournament, the top six teams from the West division (North America) will play a single elimination bracket with the top two advancing and making their way to Hawaii where they're compete against the top two teams from the East (Asia) after their top four teams play in basically a sudden death bracket. Each tournament consists of a double elimination bracket between those four teams. This is also a huge improvement over last year where trying to compare APAC and NA was a purely academic pursuit that ended up being impossible because there was no crossover at all from March through October. With NA teams making their way to Hawaii, it should hopefully minimize ping as much as possible.

Overall, very cool format. It took what was good about the haphazardly invented tournament system that was necessary due to COVID and improved on all of the things that didn't work, since they actually had time to, ya' know, plan it this year.

# Teams

I didn't particularly feel like ranking the teams or creating a power ranking, tier list, or otherwise organizing the teams by any metric in any kind of way or doing any kind of additional work. I couldn't even be bothered to go find a list someone else made of all the teams in the league, even though I'm going to have to do that eventually because I'm writing this before the teams and I don't remember the rosters for every team in the league, I don't think.

Anyway, the point here being these teams are in no particular order, I just wrote them all down as I thought of them and then went back and filled in my thoughts on each roster. At least, that's the plan. Like I said, I'm writing this first so there's actually nothing below this other than a blank line. Hi, future Shadow back from after I made the list of the teams. I did at least remember all of the teams, even if it took me a few seconds to remember the European ones for some reason.

## 1 Chengdu Hunters

Since their inception into the Overwatch League as one of the eight expansion teams for the second season of OWL, Chengdu has been a meme. After the statistically impossible shittiness of the all Chinese roster, then mixed Chinese-Korean roster that was fielded by the season one Shanghai dragons (at the time the only team that had a geolocation of China), they were bold enough to fire into the league with an all Chinese roster, consisting of entirely different players. The Shanghai Dragons went 0-40. THEY LOST EVERY SINGLE MATCH. It was something so incredibly improbably, even the meat sports world was baffled by it, with stories on normal ESPN about how improbably shit they were. It was borderline impossible to be that fucking bad, but the Dragoons went 0-40 none the less.

This is not about the Shanghai Dragons, but it's worthwhile to mention because 0-40, a perfect losing season, was the precedent for an all Chinese roster as Chengdu entered the league. In season two, GOATs was meta for about five months, through stage three before the 2-2-2 rolelock was added for stage four. In stage one, when everyone else was playing the Rein, Brig, Lucio, D.va, Zen, Zarya demon composition, Chengdu was playing Wrecking Ball, because it was the only thing that Ameng could play. The Hunters weren't good, but they rebuked the established meta and _attempted_ to do something different. It didn't really work, but they were fun to watch and they gained a lot of fans because of it and their ability to pull off the occasional upset.

For their second season, in the league's third, Chengdu just sucked. They made a few upgrades to the roster, most notably Leave who many considered to be an elite level DPS talent out of Chinese Contenders, but the roster was still mostly intact. We never got to see them until after the league went online, and they were locked in the APAC region with New York, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Seoul, all of which were capable of looking like number one teams at various points during the season. The poor pandas just got relentlessly pounded, with the only notable exception here being a week one victory over Shanghai in the Dragon's first or second match out, which ultimately didn't matter. I think they got three or four wins on the season, with a little bit of a run during the playoffs tournament due to a dramatic swing in the meta that played into the Hunters' limited strengths.

As a region, China is on the rise in terms of Overwatch. At the Gauntlet earlier this year, the Shanghai Dragons' academy team, Team C.C. absolutely pounded, taking a win away from the favorite region in Korea for China's first win. Compared to previous years, a significant number of fresh Chinese players are entering the league, and with this, Chengdu is looking to shuck the meme.

They don't want to be the team that people watch because they're kind of funny but ultimately suck, instead, they're looking to be _the_ Chinese team. With the addition of Gaga, arguably the second best main tank the region has ever produced to provide something that the Chengdu Hunters have never had in a main tank that actually plays all of the main tanks, they could have some much needed stability at a critical role. The DPS line is set to dominate if Leave can hit his strides from his time in Contenders before OWL, after a decent but not incredible rookie season. Alongside him is Jimmy, as well as Jinmu and Kaneki who are quite literally the same person. They're named after the same Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul, with the difference (I think) being a Japanese versus Chinese reading of the characters in the name, and they have the same fucking hero pool. I don't quite get this one, but from what I can tell they play different styles of the same pool. Jinmu is hyper-aggressive which results in a very feast or famine play style, where he either absolutely fucks or is giga-feeding into the entire enemy team. On the other hand, his alter ego in Kaneki is more reserved and plays with the team. This is good because when you play with Jinmu, you kind of get stuck playing Jinmu's game.

The thing that concerns me the most about this team heading into this season is the flex tank and main support positions. Elsa (flex tank) has been with the team since the beginning and has always looked consistently... Okay. It doesn't help that he's forced to play a very different style due to the inherent limitations of having Ameng as your "main" tank player, so it's possible that Elsa is actually really good but has just been held back by not having a proper main tank player like the rest of the players at his level in his position do. I wouldn't really bet on that, and China is not known for producing exceptional talents at off tank, with the best one we've seen so far in LiGE entering the league this year and going over to the Hangzhou Spark.

Then at main support, we have someone who I've never heard of with Yveltal being downgraded to a two-way contract this year. They have two flex supports in Farway1989, who appears to be completely cracked out of his mind and they recently added MMONK, who appears to be pretty good and would really help shore them up for a double flex support meta.

Overall, I think this team is a few pieces away from putting together the all Chinese superteam that we've never seen succeed at this level of competition, and I think that they could definitely have some solid performances this year and make a few of the regional tournaments, but I wouldn't expect them to win any as their potential weaknesses at main support and flex tank could be easily exploited by teams of a higher caliber.

## 2 Vancouver Titans

I don't have a ton to say about this team, which is hopefully a good thing because if the previous team was anything to go by, this project will be pushing 25,000 words. I don't think this team is very good. In season two, Vancouver's parent organization dropped the bag and picked up one of the greatest teams in Overwatch League history in Runaway from Korean Contenders. I cannot adequately explain, in the brief few words I have here, how significant this team was in Korean Overwatch and Overwatch as a whole. Runaway was founded in late 2016 and competed in some of the most iconic moments of APEX and early Contenders, with a core roster that was together since 2017. They were one of the most dominant teams, always in contention for a title.

They came into the Overwatch League as a complete unit, the entire roster picked up as one for a brand new expansion team. They entered with a ton of fans because they were still the Runaway everyone had known and loved, just moved up to the next level with a different name and color scheme. In season two, they absolutely dominated during the GOATs meta, quickly establishing themselves as the number one team in the league, taking the victory in an absolute barn burner seven map series against the San Francisco Shock in the stage one playoffs. A Shock who promptly fired back at the stage two finals match in another insane six map series with a win over the Titans. The story line was incredible, this team with so much history and talent doing so well in their rookie season up on the 'big stage' with this amazing rivalry with the Shock, another team with such great storylines. The Titans struggled a bit during stage three, being eliminated during playoffs by Shanghai, who would go on to face the Shock in the finals, with a pretty noticeable slump in stage four. During playoffs, the inexplicable decision was made to bench their absolute gigachad of a main tank in Bumper to instead bring in TiZi, a former Runaway and London Spitfire player. They managed to put it back together for a playoff run, but were utterly defeated by the Shock in a quick 4 match sweep during the Grand Finals at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.

Actually, I do have a lot to say about this team because I'm still fucking mad about it. I didn't want to go on a history lesson, but here we are.

Heading into season three, Vancouver dropped both Bumper and TiZi, with Hooreg leaving to go assistant coach under former Titans assistant coach Harsha who was now the head coach down in Houston, and Rapel also leaving for Houston to play flex support there. Overall, the only thing the roster really needed was a new main tank, which they found in the form of Fissure.

Look. I have to keep these at a somewhat reasonable length, so I can't explain much about Fissure. Basically, every team Fissure has been on goes boom. We don't know why, if it was Fissure or Fissure just happened to be on the team, but everyone agrees Fissure was a fantastic player even though the teams always crash and burn, so this move was very concerning for a number of reasons. They also brought in the legendary ex-Lunatic High and Seoul Dynasty flex support ryujehong, which made absolutely no fucking sense because Twilight was still on the roster and Twilight was definitely better, but ryujehong was popular, even with western fans, so in he comes.

After living in a mansion in Los Angeles for the 2019 season, the team was moved to Vancouver where they lived in a training facility which seemed to amount to a concrete bunker. They played at the first Dallas Homestand on opening weekend on February 8th, winning their first two matches with their all-Korean roster, and then as COVID hit, there were alleged disagreements between the players and management (which allegedly had been going back to last season with the removal of Bumper), with the resolution eventually being to move the team to Korea to compete in the new APAC division. After two losses in April, the team suddenly disappeared before eventually being listed in the North America bracket for the May Melee when it was announced by the league, which was very confusing for everybody as it would have required the players to make another trip back across the Pacific during a pandemic for seemingly no reason.

As it turns out, either the parent organization in Canucks Sports & Entertainment, or Luminosity Gaming who operates the team, had other plans.

They cut the entire roster, picked up half of a mediocre Contenders roster as well a smattering of random players. The players and their coaches were put in a position to fail, and fail they did. They looked like absolute dogshit most games, with the occasional game in which it seemed they offered some resistance, and even managing to 3-0 the imploding Dallas Fuel at one point during the season, but at best they only managed to look marginally better than the other bottom feeders, with the only exception being Shockwave, who was added a few weeks after the original new roster started playing.

For a reason that nobody knows, the organization ruined one of the greatest rosters in the history of competitive Overwatch, replacing it with a team that wouldn't even be that good in Contenders.

This season, they've made some marginal upgrades to the roster, but in a season that will be the most competitive season in the Overwatch League, with almost every single team in the league making upgrades to compete for _something_ and half of the teams in North America building superteams, this roster is almost certainly going to get shit on. The DPS line is probably the best thing about the roster, and even then I would rate it as very much below league average.

Dalton had a few okay performances on a terrible team last year, and LiNkzr has demonstrated himself to be an elite, but inconsistent, talent on the hitscan. I have no idea who Teru is, but he's their only flex DPS so either he better be good or they should hope for a year long double hitscan meta. The tank line looks pretty weak, as well as the support line. I think at best, this roster could eek out a win or two in NA, but on paper it is definitively the weakest in the region.

I don't have high hopes for them.

## 3 Boston Uprising

Speaking of bottom feeders.

Season one Boston was actually good, with the greatest coach in the history of mankind in Crusty before HuK (allegedly) forced him out and he departed to build a dynasty with the Shock, as well as a legitimate season one MVP candidate in Striker, who.... Uh... Left for the Shock...

Season two Boston started off mediocre in stage one, and failed to win a game the rest of the season, getting clowned on regularly. For the third season, they made some choice up/down/side(?)-grades to the roster, and they were still bad. Boston finished last in two consecutive seasons. It wasn't good.

This year, they're actually looking like a real time that can do something. With the addition of Lori at the head coach position, and Mineral and HuK moving on to do something else in the organization that hopefully gives them no decision making ability over the team or roster, they've actually managed to put together some decent talent. They managed to hold on to the only stand out player they've had in the last two years in Myunbong (which, who knows how they even managed to get him in the first place) on the flex support. Faith, Overwatch League Commissioner im37 (Future Shadow Note: more on this in the Toronto section, apparently) and Valentine joined from WGS in Korean Contenders, and they signed SoOn, formerly from Paris, as well as picking up Stand1 from Shanghai's bench.

Stand1 didn't look incredible on Shanghai when he was starting, and after the incredible reverse sweep over Seoul in the May Melee finals where Fearless was subbed in and proceeded to dominate, he was benched for basically the rest of the season, but he's still better than Fusions and probably the best main tank they've ever had. It might be difficult to get him and Punk on the same page, as Punk is Australian and I don't think Stand1 has ever played on a mixed roster, so this is potential for a big problem.

The support line of Faith and Myunbong is absolutely cracked, and the DPS line is pretty solid overall with a good amount of flexibility. I'm not sure where Colourhex will really fit in that rotation, but more options is always good. And since they have an actual coach now who people in the scene respect a good amount, this team will actually not be last, probably. I wouldn't expect them to really compete in any of the tournaments, but I wouldn't be shocked if they manage to qualify for a few of them, and be competitive with the titans (not Vancouver, they suck) of the region even if they will probably lose most or all of those matchups.

Overall, a solid improvement from dead last to maybe average.

<br>

## 4 Hangzhou Spark

Okay, this one is weird. From fourth place as an expansion team in their first year in season two, to pretty underwhelming in season three, this team has made _a lot_ of additions this off season.

They're now (I think) the only team in the league that has a full twelve players, but they also have almost a full Korean and full Chinese roster, with it breaking down 7-5 in favor of Korea. I look at this roster and see a lot of potential, but I have absolutely no idea who they're going to field, in what combination or how. They have arguably the two best tank players that China has ever produced in guxue and LiGe, with ColdesT and M1ka on the Chinese back line, who both looked pretty solid when we saw them play last year.

Then for DPS, they hang on to Architect who they acquired from the Shock mid-season last year, as well as GodsB who can be an elite talent, and they also bring in former Runaway Vancouver Titans flex DPS SeoMinSoo which is strange since we haven't seen him play since the Runaway Titans and even then most people seemed to believe that he was good inside of Runaway but might not be that good outside, as well as a Chinese hitscan player in Shy who roleswapped from flex support. The DPS line is strange, but I think it can be really good regardless of meta if all of their players work out.

Same for the tank line, but I have absolutely no idea who they would actually field. On one hand, they have the Chinese duo in guxue and LiGe. We know guxue is really good, and from his insane performances on Team C.C., we expect LiGe will be good, then on the Korean front we have BERNAR and Takoyaki. BERNAR has always been pretty good, despite a middling showing on a poor London Spitfire roster last year, and I think is a solid pick up especially when you also have LiGe. Between the two, one of them is bound to put it together. Takoyaki is a rookie coming in from Team Diamond/Meta Athena, but is most notable for his time on Element Mystic. Dallas Fuel head coach rush Tweeted that he believed Takoyaki could be the best main tank in the league after the Spark announced his signing.

The tank line _seems_ good, but I wonder how they've balancing the Chinese and Korean components. Are they playing in duos, or are we going to see BERNAR play alongside guxue and Takoyaki with LiGe? Are ColdesT and M1ka only going to be fielded when the Chinese tank line is in?

For the supports, ColdesT and M1ka are solid, and they still have iDK, who I thought has been pretty underrated ever since season two, with BeBe moving on to the Washington Justice and replaced with a very highly rated flex support from Element Mystic in MCD.

This roster can be very good, even if it confuses me, and I would expect to see them competing for top three in their region this year, unless they can't figure out some combination of their talents that actually works and they completely fucking implode, which is a distinct possibility. I actually can't figure out who the fuck is going to be playing when on this team.

## 5 Shanghai Dragons

I've been a fan of the Shanghai Dragons since the old 0-40 flight of the Dragoons. They started off all Chinese, before bringing in a helping of Korean players a few weeks into the season. It was insane just how fucking awful they were. Last I checked, the Dragons hold the record for the longest losing streak in professional sports history at 42 consecutive losses. They were always the first ones in the training facility in the morning, and the last ones out, practicing for 14 hours a day or more, with nothing to ever show for it.

June 6th, 2018. The Shanghai Dragons are facing off against the next shittiest team in the Florida Mayhem. The Dragoons are 0-37. The broadcast and Watchpoint desk are hyping this match up as the one that Shanghai might finally win to snap their losing streak.

![](/assets/images/shanghai_loses.png)

They tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it didn't even matter.

3-2 Florida.

The Shanghai players wept on stage. They would also lose their final two games of the season, finishing 0-40, with a 21-129-2 map win record, or just shy of a 14% map win rate.

Season two was a massive turn around for the team, in which they dumped almost everyone and overturned the entire management staff. They kept the Korean players that they had picked up in Geguri and Fearless, as well as the only good Chinese player they had in Diya. The other Korean player, Ado, left for what he hoped to be greener pastures in the new expansion team, the Washington Justice. :mfw:

Season two saw significant talent additions to the roster with the core of KongDoo Panthera from Korean Contenders as well as the absolutely fucking insane crackhead freak of nature that is diem. Gamsu was brought in from Boston to take up the main tank role after Fearless was bumped down to a two way contract on Team C.C. as he battled some health issues, or a wrist issue. One of the two. Season two started off with two loses at the hands of the Hangzhou Spark and Vancouver Titans, two of the strongest teams in the league at that point though we didn't know that yet, before they finally picked up their first win against the Boston Uprising on February 23, 2019. From there, Shanghai consistently maintained an upper-middle of the pack posture, hovering around 10th to 6th in the standings at any given time. They managed to qualify for the stage two playoffs but were defeated 1 to 3 by the monsters in the Shock, who had just completed a golden stage (winning every single match without dropping a single map for an entire stage).

Stage three was spicy for the Dragons. They decided to stop playing the meta GOATs comp that everybody else was playing, and instead started playing a triple DPS comp with YOUNGJIN on the Doomfist, Diem on Widowmaker, and DDing on Pharah. They gained so many fans just because it was exciting to finally see someone play SOMETHING that wasn't GOATs after five consecutive months of almost everyone playing the exact same thing every single match.

In the stage three playoffs, Shanghai made the most complete playoff run imaginable starting off at the lowest seed, knocking off the first seeds in both divisions in the NYXL and Titans, before taking out the Shock in the finals match 4 to 3. It was actually incredible to watch and to date is one of my favorite things to have happened in the Overwatch League.

Oh God I'm doing a history lesson again. Anyway, they were alright in stage four and were pretty quickly eliminated in the season playoffs after taking out Philly.

Season three saw significant roster changes again, with Gamsu, YOUNGJIN, CoMa, and envy all departing. They proceeded to build an absolute super team under the guidance of former season one Los Angeles Valiant head coach Moon. To the roster of Geguri, DDing, Diem, Izayaki, and Luffy, they added the absolutely fucking insane crackhead freak of nature that is Fleta from Seoul, along with Stand1, Void, LeeJaeGon, and LIP. Fearless also rejoined the team after his time on Team C.C.

They absolutely dominated their division for the entirety of the season, picking up wins in two of the three tournaments and an outstanding win record. The story line was fantastic, the Dragoons now on top of the league, with other fantastic story lines like Fearless being on that absolutely tragic team, being demoted, doing his time in Contenders, now back and looking like the best main tank in the league leading his team to victory. While they weren't able to win the league, landing in third place in the Grand Finals after a defeat at the hands of the Shock, they still had an absolutely phenomenal season.

This season, Fearless has been traded to the Dallas Fuel at his request, with Fate joining from Florida to rejoin Moon from their time together in pre-OWL as well as from season one Valiant, with Erster being brought in to supplement the DPS line. Stand1 also left for Boston, but after being thoroughly benched for Fearless, he probably wouldn't have played much anyway. Molly has also joined from Chengdu, being the only Chinese member of the roster as a flex support. Overall, they cut some of the players that didn't play much like Geguri and DDing. I thought Luffy might be a nice piece to hold on to for double flex support metas, but supposedly Molly can com in Korean and Molly did look very good from his time on a middling Chengdu, so that might be a slight upgrade.

For season four, Shanghai has another super team poised to take it all this year. Their DPS line is cracked, as is the support line. The only possible question on this roster is how well Fate will integrate, and if he's as good as Fearless. At worst, I think he's a very, very slight downgrade, but under coach Moon I think there's potential that everything is still great. If Shanghai doesn't place first in Asia this year, it would be pretty surprising and a bit of a disappointment.

<br>

## 6 Florida Mayhem

Speaking of absolute shitters from season one that have managed to turn it around, the Florida Mayhem. They started life in OWL by picking up the core of Rogue from Europe, which basically consisted of a bunch of Scandinavians. They sucked and the majority of their wins came from their repeated bouts against the Dragoons. In season two, they overhauled the roster to be a mix of Korean and new western players that they had picked up. They sucked, the western players were dropped mid-season and a bunch of Korean players were brought in. For season three, they have a new general manager and a fantastic coach in Kuki, who previously played main tank (back up) for the Valiant under coach Moon (as well as one infamous game where Moon benched main support player Custa because he was 'too smart' and replaced him for an actual Overwatch League match with main tank player Kuki playing Lucio. That was fucking stupid and Moon was fired shortly afterwards.) Kuki then moved on to coach Runaway in Korean Contenders for a while and quickly demonstrated himself to be a legitimate coaching talent.

The roster was overhauled again, keeping the best Korean players that had been acquired during season two and making a few choice additions in Yaki and Gangnamjin from Runaway. During season three, they proved themselves to be a legitimate contender with the top teams, making the final of the May Melee but ultimately falling to the San Francisco Shock.

For season four, Fate has departed to rejoin Moon on Shanghai, and main support Kris has been replaced by former Runaway Vancouver Titans main support Slime, which is a massive upgrade. They also added Checkmate from OZ Gaming to round out the DPS line, which was controversial because OZ Gaming sucked and was the worst team in Contenders at the time Checkmate was picked up. That said, two other players from the team were also picked up for the league, which is wild. From what we've seen of Checkmate so far in various tournaments that the team has participated in during the off season, he does seem to be a legitimate asset which could help fill in some of the gaps in the DPS line.

To replace Fate, they've brought in OGE. OGE is kind of like Fissure. Everyone rates him as a very talented player, but it seems like he never works out. He entered the league in a few weeks into season one with the Dallas Fuel, where he was promptly suspended for account boosting. Upon returning, he didn't play a ton that season. In season two, as the starting main tank, he seemed to be good, but inconsistent. That said, the team around him was very weak and likely didn't give him very much of an opportunity to succeed. In season three, he moved over to Los Angeles to play alongside one of the greatest western off tank players in SPACE, but it seemed like they were never really able to get on the same page and so they looked very mediocre overall, complicated by a Finnish support line that was struggling to adapt to the changing meta and pace of the game. Now heading down to Florida, it feels like OGE is really at Last Chance U. He's playing alongside a top 5 (arguably top 3) flex tank in Gargoyle, a top 5 support line with Slime and GangNamJin, and a top 5-ish DPS line. If he can't make it work at Florida, he was the problem all along.

Florida is a team that will be hard pressed to compete with the other North American super teams, but I think that should be their goal. They have the talent, structure, and staff to be a legitimate contender, and should be looking at 3 to 5 in the rankings this season, with at least one finals appearance in the monthly tournaments if the meta is right.

## 7 San Francisco Shock

Speaking of shitters from season one that have managed to turn it around, the San Francisco Shock. You might have read their name a few times, and there's a very good reason for that. The San Francisco Shock are the definitive greatest team in the history of professional Overwatch. Since season two, nobody has displayed the same degree of dominance for the same period of time than the Shock have.

In season one, they were the third or fourth worst team, because they had a very different strategy. Rather than trying to compete, they picked up a mediocre roster as well as a smattering of players who weren't even eligible for the league because they were too young. For a year, they developed these players on the bench into elite warlords of the game, which was helped immensely after coach Crusty was forced out of Boston and looking for a new home. Crusty is, without a doubt, the best coach in Overwatch history. He took those young players and molded them into a fearsome force. Moth, Super, ChoiHyoBin, and Sinatraa were the three players that were picked up primarily to incubate on the bench, all of them came of age at some point during the season and played a small number of matches towards the end of the season. With additions of some Korean players from various teams between season one and two, the Shock entered the league as a decent team who got off to a slow start in stage one, squeaking into playoffs and heating up to take on Vancouver in the finals, where they were ultimately beaten in an absolutely legendary match.

Stage two saw complete, utter, unmitigated, and unmistakable dominance from the squad, who won every single map of every single game , something that had never been done before and not been done since. They made the stage three finals where they lost to Shanghai, and entered the finals playoffs as one of the favorites. They were upset by the Atlanta Reign in the first round in shocking _heheheh_ fashion, before slaughtering their way through the loser's bracket without mercy, 3-0'ing anybody who dared stand in their way, before dismantling Vancouver in front of tens of thousands of screaming fans at the Grand Finals.

Season three was the same. Shock on top, everyone else begging for mercy. They've lost some key pieces this season. Main support Moth has moved over to the Gladiators with FDGod coming in from Paris to replace him, and a bit of shuffling going on at DPS. ANS retires after one season, Rascal departs for free agency, eventually landing in Philadelphia who is competing in Korea this year. Twilight managed to land here during season three after the Titans imploded, which is fucking disgusting because they have the best flex support in the league, with the second best to back him up. At DPS, Nero joins from Guangzhou, with Glister coming in from London to join Striker and Ta1yo.

The tank line is disgusting, with Super electing to forgo becoming a massive streamer on Twitch to stay a medium sized one and run it back for the three-peat, and he's on the fucking bench for Smurf who is somehow more disgusting alongside Choi who's a fucking freak of nature. The back line is illegal with the **_FIRST AND SECOND_** best flex supports in the league on the same roster who are both absolutely fucking cracked, with the only potential question being FDGod, who entered the league after a few weeks into season three as a rookie for Paris. He quickly evolved, proving himself to be an absolute crackhead on the Lucio and a very capable player on the other main support heroes as well. Moth was an integral part of this team, and his leadership and ult tracking might be sorely missed, but if anyone is going to make it work, it would be coach Crusty.

Meanwhile, the DPS line is insane, with arguably the best DPS player in the league in Striker being joined by some top tier talents in Nero and Glister to replace the departing top tier talents in Architect, Rascal, and ANS. Oh, and the Super Genji, of course.

The San Francisco Shock have won the league twice in a row. They want to win three times. They will accept nothing less.

## 8 Dallas Fuel

......................Speaking of shitters from season one..................

Dallas entered the Overwatch League in season one with great expectations. Formerly Team Envy, they became the Dallas Fuel after their parent company Envy Gaming bought a franchise slot which became the Dallas Fuel, carrying over the old roster with a few additions.

Team Envy was most notable in the pre-Overwatch League days for being the first western roster to go to Korea to compete in APEX, and they won. It was impossible that a team of western players would beat an elite Korean team, but they did, taking the win in APEX season one.

So when they entered the league and were absolute dogshit, their fans were very unhappy. Things didn't improve but for a brief span in stage four when they just barely managed a few upsets and a decent overall performance in the stage, but it ultimately amounted to nothing.

In season two, their roster was scrutinized heavily for keeping on a lot of 'legacy' players who were considered to be past their prime, but for some reason they remained on the team and collected a paycheck without playing. Questionable management decisions, questionable player pick ups, and questionable strategies underlined another poor performance in season two.

Season three sought to improve, but all the same criticisms of season two were back again, with a bunch of players who were never going to play collecting paychecks from the bench for no discernible reason. A few upgrades were made at various positions, most notably at DPS where Doha was brought in from Element Mystic and Decay acquired from the Gladiators in a trade for OGE.

Decay is an absolute fucking freak of nature crackhead, who alongside Doha, carried the team to a handful of victories early on in the season. As time went on, something was going wrong with Decay. It was announced that Decay would be taking a week off, during which they were utterly humiliated by the recently imploded Vancouver Titans, and rumors from head coach Brad over at the Atlanta Reign said that Decay had benched himself. This made a lot of people angry because it was unsubstantiated and many viewed it as unprofessional for a head coach to be commenting on other team's drama in that manner, but it turns out he was right.

For whatever reason, Decay was no longer enjoying his time on Dallas. It was rumored that he wanted an all Korean roster, which Dallas had planed on early in the season but ultimately pivoted away from at some point. Combined with a number of unknown factors, the Dallas Fuel eventually agreed to release Decay at his request a few weeks later. It was after the roster lock, which meant that Decay wouldn't be eligible to play until this season of the Overwatch League.\*

\* See Washington Justice section for how this turned out.

After that, it was all downhill. They picked up Onigod to try and fill the gap left by Decay. He did his best on 200 ping from Europe, and looked good, but the Titanic had already struck the iceberg at this point and there was no saving it.

Dallas is sick and fucking tired of losing, and are finally looking to break the Dallas Fuel Cycle of Misery once and for all. They're dropped everyone except for Doha, brought in Rush from the 2020 Paris Eternal at head coach, given him a blank check for the roster, and told him to win.

So he's built a super team. In from Paris comes SP9RK1E, Hanbin, Fielder, and Xzi, rejoining with former Element Mystic team mate Doha, also being joined by Fearless from Shanghai, Rapel from Vancouver by way of Houston, and Jecse from Seoul by way of Houston. As far as super teams go, it's not the strongest super team, but it's up there and on paper should punch for the top of the charts. They're basically holding an Element Mystic reunion party.

That said, it's Dallas. We are at the beginning of the cycle of misery. Every year, the Fuel are back, until they shit the bed. Fuel should be one of the best team in the division, trading blows with other super teams and competing for tournament wins. If they can't manage that this year, they honestly might as well delete the organization.

## 9 Houston Outlaws

.................................................................................................Speaking of shitters from season one...................................................

Houston were slightly below average in season one, and that's kind of the highlight of their existence. They sucked at GOATs during season two, and got absolutely fucked at the beginning of season three, being toted around to all of the different homestands with half their roster being sick where they proceeded to lose a significant amount of games early on. Things never really looked up for them beyond that, but they're looking to be... Decent this year. They also had some issues with ownership, in the sense that for a while they didn't have an owner. I don't really feel like covering that, so moving on.

They have Danteh, who was acquired in a trade from the San Francisco Shock in exchange for Houston academy main tank Smurf. Think back to the Shock section. Remember what I said about Smurf? Well, turns out that SFS ended up coming out massively ahead on that trade, especially since one of Houston's biggest weaknesses since season one has been at the main tank position. Oopsies. Danteh is really good, but he's been the only good player of on a bad team basically since he joined and hasn't been good enough to hard carry this team to relevance.

Now, former player CoolMatt has been promoted to general manager, Junkbunk is brought in from Crusty's Coaching Academy in San Fran to co-head coach the team with Harsha, and Jake returns from a year of casting as a player-coach. Overall, this team is in the best position they've ever been to succeed, but the roster leaves a lot of questions and there's a lot of room for this to go poorly. Danteh and Hydration are carried over from last year's squad. JJANGGU and Piggy are picked up from Talon esports as the tank line, where they had pretty good performances together. KSF joins from the Valiant, with Jake joining primarily as a coach, but also occupying a roster spot as a player if needed. They also managed to sign Happy from Guangzhou, who is a significant upgrade on over LiNkzr on the dedicated hit scan roles. With the addition of a highly respected coach in Junkbuck, I'm expecting they should do at least mediocre hopefully, which would arguably be an improvement.

The thing that worries me the most about the roster would be the support line. I thought Crimzo was criminally underrated when he was on Dallas last year, with some people on Reddit calling him the worst flex support in the league while I probably would have placed him around number ten, so I think with a better team around him, he should be able to produce results. Joobi is a big question mark, coming straight out of the collegiate scene, which we've never really seen before in the Overwatch League. Hopefully he's good, because a weakness at main support can be pretty easily exploited by good teams, and they're up against a lot of those.

I think this Houston roster will be pretty good, but might not actually pick up many wins this season. They're in North America, which has a pretty large number of super team rosters being constructed, so realistically Houston is looking to beat out teams like Vancouver, London, Paris, and whichever team inevitably ends up imploding, provided it's not Houston themselves. I think they should be pretty closely matched with someone like the Uprising, and they shouldn't sleep on London or Paris because the rookie European rosters could absolutely take out someone like Houston if they're caught sleeping.

Overall, I'm not quite sure. Again, I think they'll be good but will be hard pressed to actually reflect their improvement with a delta in the standings compared to previous years.

## 10 Washington Justice

Hey, finally someone who isn't a season one shitter. They're a season two shitter.

They entered the league with the season two expansion, and they fucking sucked. Their roster was an absolute mishmash of questionable decisions that didn't play well together during the meta that's required the most team coordination out of any meta we've ever seen in Overwatch, under the guidance of an overpaid WizardHyeong coming in off the high of a season one success with New York before revealing himself to be a bit of a Bill O'Brien. Some of their players just did not belong in the league, and they were just bad. At one point, someone on the broadcast (I think it was Sideshow) branded them as the "entertainment thieves" because they were just bad to watch. They sucked, but couldn't even suck in an entertaining way like Chengdu, so it was just boring to watch them slam their heads into a brick wall over and over again without showing any results.

They had a hot streak after the 2-2-2 role lock, managing to knockoff Vancouver, almost exclusively due to the fact that Corey was now allowed to play Hanzo and thus Corey was allowed to turbo fuck. Seriously, he set a record for eliminations in a map on Hollywood _against an actually good team._ He absolutely slaughtered for four glorious weeks, but they still sucked so they didn't make playoffs. Coming into season two, I actually had hopes for them. They... Uh... "upgraded" the tank line in r0ar and ELLIVOTE, even though it was supposed to be LullSiSH and ELLIVOTE, but unfortunately LULLSiSH was never able to get a visa and then COVID happened so he never made it. Turns out r0ar was a feeder, which was sort of a problem. JJANU and Stitch were brought in from the Runaway Titans roster in mid-May, but were never really able to turn the team around.

They lost key pieces like Corey to Valorant, and Stratus to retirement, leaving them with a DPS line of Ttuba and Stitch, which really struggled in certain metas due to the lack of flexibility. By the way, Ttuba's name is 'A butt' backwards and I think that's fucking great. Now with a new general manager, and a new coach, the Justice are looking to win.

Now do they have the roster to do so?

So remember earlier? When I talked about Dallas? You remember Decay? He was released from his contract with the Fuel on August 3, 2020, which was a few days after the roster lock which meant that teams were no longer able to sign free agent players as the league headed into the playoffs. This was implemented to prevent a team from basically trying to build a list minute super team just to win a championship.

Well, in the year of COVID, and with the announcement that the Grand Finals would be taking place online, but with all teams competing _in_ Korea, the League acknowledged that it might be an issue for a team who qualified for the tournament to get all of their players into Korea and through the mandatory two week quarantine at the same time, so they removed the roster lock and allowed teams to sign a new player to replace a player who would be ineligible to travel to Korea.

Have you figured it out yet? The Justice still had LullSiSH on the roster, despite having transitioned from a mixed to a full Korean roster and dropped his long time tank partner in ELLIVOTE, because they promised LullSiSH that they would do everything that they could to get him a U.S. visa so he had the best possible chances of finding a team. A pretty stand up move from the org, but realistically nobody was going to pick him up anyway. Then, when the league made their announcement... Well, it was like when you toss the Guide Voodoo Doll into the lava to summon the Wall of Flesh in Terraria.

They had a player, who definitely wouldn't be able to travel anywhere sitting on the roster, with one of the hottest free agents of all time sitting in his apartment playing Valorant.

So they signed Decay for playoffs. I think technically he played in their final regular season game, but clearly the intention was to bulk up for a miraculous underdog playoff run.

The meta swings wildly, where now the dominant composition is Roadhog and Zarya on tank, with Tracer Ashe DPS and a Zenyatta Mercy support line.

It is hard to express just how fucking perfect this situation was. Despite being a DPS player, during the GOATs meta DPS players played an excessive amount of Zarya, and Decay was a good Zarya. Instead of having to play Sigma, which JJANU was pretty mediocre on even when he was with the Titans, he now got to whip out his Hog. Stitch suddenly decided to become good, and Ttuba grinded Tracer to the point where he actually looked shockingly good compared to some early performances that year which looked tragic. ArK, an overall mediocre main support on account of his inability to play Lucio at the level of other players in his role which lead to him being replaced on the NYXL roster, was now back on his elite tier Mercy and Aimgod who had struggled that year to actually make an impact was now on his signature hero.

Decay fucked. Decay mega fucked. Decay giga fucked. Decay terra fucked. Decay unleashed an entire petabyte of fuck upon the league. Being able to take r0ar out of the line up actually solved all of their problems, also getting one of the hardest carries in the league on a hard carry hero during a meta where that hero could hard carry. He and JJANU created so much space that Stitch was able to stand behind them and click heads like an absolute fucking crack addict while Ttuba zipped around and feasted on the entrails of supports while Aimgod lobbied volley after volley of deadly orbs through the skull of anyone who dared walk in front of him. ArK was there too, but everyone forgets about you when you play Mercy. He's good at Mercy though.

They turned into monsters, slaughtering their way through the playoffs, narrowly being defeated by the Shock 3:2, which would have resulted in the Shock being dumped into the loser's bracket again. So many great story lines, like the Paris Eternal and the Florida Mayhem were ruthlessly crushed to dust under the rage of the Washington Justice. Eventually, it wasn't enough and they fell to Philly in the loser's finals. They were one match away from the actual Might Ducks underdog story, but lost when it mattered most. It was such an incredible turn around in such a short time, and definitely charts in my top OWL moments of all time.

So what's next for the Justice? Well, they're sick and fucking tired of losing. They had an opportunity with Decay's foot already in the door to do something special. So what did they do? They dropped ArK, Stitch, AimGod, JJANU, and r0ar. Uh oh. JJANU was really good though... Wasn't he? I mean, he was the second best off tank in 2019... Even if his Sigma is a bit eh. They're going to fuck this up, aren't they?

Well, they did one thing right. Decay is the kind of talent that you tear a check out of your checkbook, you sign it, and you slide it across the table to him to let him fill in his favorite number. Whatever he wanted, they absolutely had to give it to him because he is an absolute freak, and so they did. Around him, they added Mag, arguably the best main tank in all regions of Contenders from Runaway, as well as Jerry from Boston to round out the DPS line.

That one was a bit controversial, personally I probably would have kept Stitch who popped off during their playoff run, but during the Toilet Bowl (Boston vs Houston) (one of the greatest games of all time) at the Washington Justice Homestand at the start of the 2020 season, Jerry was kind of popping off and the entire Anthem was chanting his name, so that one will be popular with the fans, and he is pretty good. Ttuba sticks around from last year, and on a good team I think he actually could be a really good player.

Then to play alongside Mag in the off tank role they got Fury from Philly. Fury was on the season one championship London roster and has always been among the top four at his position, trading blows with anyone else to be number one, an absolutely massive signing. The support line is extremely controversial with BeBe and Closer.

BeBe coming over from Hangzhou after a middling season overall, and while he's not the most mechanically gifted flex support, I think he's decent, with solid positioning. While he isn't a play-maker, there's already so many of those on the roster you might not want any more. Same thing with Closer, who suffered somewhere on the bench in Dallas for whatever reason. He was also on the London championship roster, though he wasn't starting for most of the season, and I don't think he played during the finals at all. I think Closer could also be solid. Pre, the general manager, said they ran the support line through a bunch of different hero combinations to simulate various metas and were happy with how they performed in trials, so hopefully they're able to support the weight of the absolute super team in front of them.

To backup Fury, they brought in Ria, also formerly on the Spark but who was out most of last season with a wrist issue. Ria's a pretty solid off tank, and was definitely somewhere in the top ten in 2019, so while I don't know what he would play and when, I guess he's a nice to have. Then in February, they added Assassin to the lineup, another Runaway alum and also kind of a freak on flex DPS. Overall, the DPS lines and tank lines are so completely stacked that as long as the supports don't actually turn off their monitors, this team should be elite.

While I wouldn't put money on them to win it all, I think they should be in the conversation, with at least one appearance in the finals of a monthly tournament. They should trade blows with other super teams like Dallas, the Gladiators, and maybe even the Shock, though last season taught us never to bet against the Shock.

## 11 Philadelphia Fusion

Philadelphia is cursed. It's like they're allergic to winning. Any time they make it to 'the big game' which they do fairly often, they choke it away. They did in season one when they lost to London in New York at the Grand Finals, then like twice last season where they were terminally unable to win a tournament, and then again in playoffs where they got clowned on by Seoul and Shanghai.

They're always second place. It's almost sad. After heating up at the end of season one to make a run through the playoffs all the way to the Grand Finals, only to get bodied by London 3-0 in the Barclays Center in New York, Philly struggled to ever put it back together during season two. They hovered around the middle of the pack, seemingly never really understanding the GOATs meta to compete at the highest level.

In season three, they looked to spend big to make themselves good, and they were. Despite that though, they never managed to but it together to actually win anything worthy of note. They made it through the loser's bracket to make it to Korea for the playoffs, only to get dominated by both the APAC teams in quick succession, ending fourth.

After a decent season that was ultimately capped off with disappointment, head coach KDG is gone, replaced with former Paris GM NineK, an alum of Crusty's Coaching Academy in San Fran. KDG moves over to Toronto, taking Sado and Heesu with him. Ivy departs for New York and Fury heads down to Washington.

To replace Sado, they bring in Mano who was cut after New York decided to go for a rebuild. sHockWave is brought in to replace Heesu after a phenomenal season being the only good player on Vancouver after they imploded, and Poko steps back into the starting off tank role after splitting time with Fury last year. Recently, it was announced that Rascal would be joining the team as they were having trouble getting EQO a Korean visa, since the Fusion will be playing in the APAC region this year. This will likely affect Poko, FunnyAstro, and sHockWave as well, but we aren't really sure and those are still just rumors.

The concerning thing here is Mano. Now, Mano is a great main tank who was a corner stone of New York's consistent success ever since season one, but he has a very passive, reactive play style, which is probably the reason why New York was never able to get it done when it mattered. Sado, meanwhile, was dummy aggressive. Ever since their inception, Philadelphia has been one of the most aggressive teams in the league, but now they're bringing in a player who is basically the opposite of that into the role that plays the largest part in setting the tone and pace for the game.

It's a complete clash of ideas, and I have no idea how that's actually going to work. It is quite possible this team just collapses and feeds, despite having what should be a very solid roster on paper. They could still be good, though I think they're going to struggle to reach the same heights of success that they had last year as the second ranked team in NA.

Again, the roster itself is good, with a cracked DPS line and support line, and while both of the players in the tank position are solid, I think it's going to be extremely challenging for them to integrate this roster and there is a massive potential for an utter collapse.

<br>

## 12 Guangzhou Charge

The charge seem to be in a bit of a rebuild year.

Arachne, a CCA alum, takes the head coaching mantle with Daemin and Neko as his assistant coaches. I think that's a pretty solid coaching staff.

Chara and Shu are gone, with Chara moving into coaching and Shu heading off to join the Gladiators. To replace them, KariV comes in from Toronto and Mandu from the bench in New York. Rio and Cr0ong are still here, a very solid tank line, with Jihun being in to back up Rio presumably, or to compete for the starting spot if someone has been hitting the funny gas.

The DPS line, like the support line, has been overhauled. Happy leaves for Houston and Nero for the Shock, with choisehwan and MYKaylee coming in to join Eileen. Overall, I think this roster is weaker than last years, but is decent considering its the product of a very clear rebuild. I don't think they're going to win any tournaments this year as they did managed to take the Summer Showdown away from Shanghai last year, but I don't think they're going to be the worst team in the region.

I would say Rio is an underrated main tank, and last year Cr0ng was both a rookie of the year and MVP contender, so everyone knows how good he is. The biggest weakness I see on the roster is the support line. KariV has had elite performances in the past, but he has also struggled with consistency in one of the most highly contested and highest performing roles in the league, and I would say he is a definitive downgrade from an elite talent in Shu. Mandu never really played on New York, but people said that he was a more aggressive version of Anamo and kept wanting him in last year, so I'll reserve my judgment, but I would have rather seen them hang on to another very consistent and underrated piece in Chara or go for someone like Tobi instead. I've never heard of their two new DPS players, but hopefully they're good because they have some very large shoes to fill.

The Charge aren't going to reach the heights they did last year, and are going to be fighting to stay in the middle of the pack in Asia this year.

<br>

## 13 Atlanta Reign

The Atlanta Reign.

After a solid showing in their first season after coming in as an expansion team, everyone had very high hopes for them in season three, with many analysts putting them in the top three, or at least the top five. They proceeded to shit the bed and struggle to even be average.

This year, they're looking to I guess make improvements by bringing in a few new pieces at DPS, but I don't know how much that's going to help. Also they have a weird thing for animal names.

Edison and Pelican will now make up the core of the DPS like, with Pelican coming in from O2 blast as one of the most highly rated DPS talents available from Contenders this off season. Kai joins after the Valiant fucking implode to be the hard hitscan specialist, permabenching the already permabenched SharP. Erster departs for hopefully greener pastures in Shanghai after being reduced from a potential league MVP at the end of season two, which many had pegged as a leading MVP candidate entering season three, to a silly hero specialist who looked tragic whenever Sephy did decide to scrape him off the bench and drop him in the server.

Gator and Hawk are still on tap for the tank line, and they need to really step it up this year and prove that they were actually as good as their run in the Gauntlet in early 2020 led us to believe. In the back line, Dusttin Bowerman (the artist formerly known as Dogman), is out and Lr1s is promoted from mostly a bench player last year to a starter, and Masaa sticks around. I think Lr1s has fixed his name, now being Ir1s, which happened because he's Korean and basically fucked up and thought the 'L' was actually a capital 'i'. That was pretty funny and even lead to ZP once calling him LR-15, which was just fuckin' great.

Masaa is solid, probably slightly above league average for main supports, but LR-15 failed to impress me from his playtime at the end of last season. Hopefully he's able to up his production this year, because there are a lot of fantastic flex supports out there.

I would say this roster is solid on paper, and should perform above average for North America, but probably won't be able to consistently compete with the super team rosters of the upper echelons of the region.

The thing that worries me most here is the coaching staff. Sephy (Brad) is still the head coach. He's given a lot of credit for architecting the season one San Francisco Shock. Now, if you remember your history lesson from earlier, you might remember that they sucked. Yes, they did. However, he did due a great job in developing the plan to straight tank a season in favor of signing future elites that were too young to even play. It worked out great, but he was shipped off at some point during season one without ever being able to see his grand plan to fruition, instead that was placed in the tender, loving, magical hands of God. AKA Crusty after he was run out of Boston for no discernible reason.

I don't know if Brad actually has what it takes to execute a roster successfully. He's good at putting them together, but we've never seen him actually make it work. In season two, when Atlanta was good, they had Casores as an assistant coach who supposedly was the one doing the majority of the actual player coaching. Interesting note: Casores is off to San Fran this year to join the next generation of students in Crusty's Coaching Academy. He's in God's hands now.

Who was this segment about? Oh yeah, Atlanta. I hope they're better than last year. I think they will be, but I think they're going to assume the Gladiator's old position of being the gatekeeper between the lower ranked teams and the actual good teams.

<br>

## 14 New York Excelsior

Just as New York fans have finally decided they've had enough, the Excelsior have decided they've had enough too. They're rebuilding, with almost everybody gone.

In season one, they were the most consistent and dominant team, picking up two of the four stage championships but ultimately flaming out early in playoffs. In season two, they played third fiddle to the Titans and Shock, never managing to make a stage finals and being cut down in playoffs. In season three, they hovered around second or third place in APAC but never managed to make it far in any of the tournaments, and were pretty swiftly eliminated in playoffs. Throughout the history of the Overwatch League, they've probably been the best team, being the only one who was actually good in all three seasons, but with the talent on their roster they always should have been so much more but were just never able to get it done.

They made some pretty significant alterations to their roster last year in a move that we were told was supposed to enable more aggressive play, in contrast to their formerly very reactive and defensive style of Overwatch, but it never materialized.

Now, JJoNak is the only starter left from last year's roster. They've made some changes to the coaching staff, and retained BiaNcA who was mostly on the bench last year to serve as their new off tank.

Yakpung comes in at main tank from a redemption and training arc on O2 Blast after an absolutely disastrous showing on the season two Toronto Defiant. In DPS, they actually picked up some absolute crackheads in Gwangboong and FEATH5R, with Flora and Ivy also being very solid. In order to play alongside JJoNak, they bring in Friday, from the worst rated team in Contenders. Yeah, this one is a bit of a head scratcher, especially with people like Tobi, Chara, and SanGuiNar being out there somewhere.

I don't have high hopes for this team, because this is a very clear rebuilding year. They're bringing in a lot of young and unproven pieces with the hopes that they're going to hit on at least a few of them, they next year they can figure out what didn't work and bring in some upgrades form the next crop of Contenders players or in free agency. That said, this team does have enough talent that they could easily punch well above their weight class, especially if they find a few metas that are heavily dependent on a hard carry performance at DPS, which this line up could easily do.

One of the key players to watch here is going to be JJoNak. After an utterly unbelievable performance in season one where he played Zenyatta as a third DPS and earned himself the season one MVP award, he's never quite looked as dominant and has been eclipsed by other talents in his role like Viol2t and Twilight. JJoNak has always been the most successful when he's the focal point of his team, and they all hop on him for a piggy back ride carry to victory while investing every single resource they have in him. This didn't really work last year, which is why they struggled then compared to any other time. With a now decidedly downgraded roster, it's going to work even less. JJoNak is going to have to transition from being _the_ player to being a team player that enables the rest of his roster to succeed rather then draining them of resources, because I just can't see that working out for them with this roster this year.

In Asia, New York is likely going to have a tough go of it. They're going to have to fight hard to stay in the middle of the pack, unless they absolutely pop off and one of the teams that I would consider to be above them implodes, which is possible, in which case they could be looking around fourth and maybe biting third's ankles.

<br>

## 15 Los Angeles Gladiators

The gatekeepers.

Ever since season one, they've been the wall that stands between the upper echelon of teams and the unwashed masses. After a very disappointing season three in which they were expected to finally be given a seat at the table of the elites, but ended up with an uncoordinated tank line, somewhat washed up support line, and a DPS line that was begging for everyone else to just stop feeding for ten seconds so they could hard carry the team to relevance.

Well, they're sick of that and have decided to simply buy that seat at the table and build a super team. MuZe, probably the second best main tank talent available in Contenders is in alongside Western off tank god SPACE. Birdring is back after an incredible redemption story last year. On London in season one, there were rumors of attitude issues that culminated in him being benched with a "wrist injury". In season two, we never really saw him as a consistent part of the roster, constantly being swapped in and out, before he was finally done and was rumored to retire. Now, even on London, people argued that he was washed up and had never managed to reach the same heights that he had shown back in 2017 on Kongdoo Panthera and later Cloud9 KongDoo, so when the Glads brought him in for season three, a lot of people expected him to come in, be a huge problem for the team dynamic, flame out, and retire.

That never happened. He played basically every game with nary a peep, and even when he wasn't in we've never heard anything bad about him. He's since had a revival, popping off in his role and looking like the best player on the team, at least until they brought in kevster about halfway through the season. With a DPS line of birdring, MirroR, and kevster, they have an extremely flexible DPS core that should be able to adapt to any meta that's thrown at them this season and I expect that we'll see a lot of rotation in and out, probably between birdring and MirroR depending on the meta with kevster being the main stay.

The tank line should hopefully look as good as they were supposed to look last year if MuZe and SPACE can start reading from the same book, and eventually maybe even the same page, something SPACE and OGE failed to do last season. The support line has been upgraded exponentially with Shu from Guangzhou and Moth from the Shock in a shocking move that nobody saw coming. Skewed was also brought in from the worst team in Contenders. Remember when I said they somehow promoted three players to OWL? They were fucking trash. I don't get it. I guess their players really popped off in tryouts.

This team has a lot of potential and should be one of the teams to beat in NA, who should trade blows with the other regional super teams in Dallas, Shock, and Washington. Additionally, this is probably the last chance for the iron shouldered demigod David "dpei" Pei, the head coach. Entering his fourth season at the helm, he's been long considered to be one of the best coaches in the league but has never really managed to show anything for it other than a team that's always just nipping at the heels of actual greatness.

<br>

## 16 Toronto Defiant

This team has fielded a wildly different roster every season. Entering as a season two expansion team, they were all Korean, who imploded due to internal issues with the team and ended up a mixed roster that was absolutely tragic. One such example of this implosion was when someone, allegedly the off tank player envy (ironic) malded so hard at the DPS line that he furiously told the coaching staff they should pick up a random player from open division, so the madlads actually fucking did it and picked up im37. Also, apparently this internal division and toxicity was so bad that Stellar just straight up retired and so im37 was somewhat supposed to replace him, but I choose to believe it was just a middle finger to (allegedly) envy who was later traded to Shanghai before dropping off the face of the Earth.

It was actually one of the funniest things ever, and im37's story was a fantastic one that the broadcast booth and the desk absolutely latched onto. Basically, im37 was a hitscan warlord on the soloque ladder, who joined an open division team called Wave Check on March 14th. Like ten days later he joined NA Contenders team Second Wind, where he was for eleven days before moving up to the Toronto Defiant. So basically, this motherfucker pulled off a speed run of the entire Overwatch path to pro, making it from his first ever team to the Overwatch League in maybe three weeks. After a pop off performance in his first match, he was called down for a post match interview with Danny, who is a Korean-English translator and would interview Korean players and translate live for the English broadcast.

Danny asked his question in English, then translated it for im37, who he then offered the microphone to. Usually the interviewer just holds the microphone up to their face and then respond and then they bring it back to themselves to translate and whatever. [im37 reaches out, grabs the microphone out of his hand and proceeds to answer in English](https://youtu.be/dmlAktd2utw?t=716). Turns out he was pretty fluent in English and nobody knew, and everybody started creasing and for the rest of the season it was a big meme about Danny retaining possession of the microphone when players tried to steal it. Then the new meme became [im37 was going to become commissioner of the Overwatch League](https://youtu.be/VHkptOr7NEA), because clearly that was the next step up.

im37 didn't play a ton for the rest of the season, and was bumped back down to Contenders and did his time, and has now found another chance on Boston. It would have made more sense to do the im37 history lesson with Boston and not Toronto, but oh well. Anyway, looking forward to seeing him again and even yesterday (at the time of writing) during the Experimental Card Tournament, on the broadcast Matt offhandedly referred to him as 'The Comish' so I'm glad that meme is going to be alive and well this year.

You know what hasn't been alive and well? The Toronto Defiant. So after a dogshit season one, and a season two roster that was seemingly picked up mostly for popularity on Twitch and engagement rather than actual wins which resulted in a very mediocre year, they've now decided that they want to try actually winning games. Unfortunately, they've kind of gone about that in a very questionable manner.

KDG is brought in from Philly after an overall successful year, bringing with him Heesu at DPS and Sado at main tank. In comes Michelle from the Seoul Dynasty who was benched for the entire year, for no discernible reason, in favor of playing Marve1 (a main tank) at off tank which didn't work 90% of time time and was by all accounts a bad idea, to join Sado. Their support line is pretty solid with two highly rated Korean players in Aztac and AnSoonJae coming into the league as rookies, along with Na1st for flex DPS.

Now, on paper that roster sounds maybe okay. It has a lot of unproven rookies, and Michelle who is a big question mark because we haven't seen him really play since season two Seoul where he looked okay, but then for some reason Logix and Beast are kicking around as the only two non-Koreans on this team.

I could actually see Logix getting some playtime, especially in metas with heavy double sniper or something like a Tracer Ashe meta, to play alongside Heesu. Beast on the other hand... I do not see a world in which he plays over Sado, unless he just specializes in something, probably Wrecking Ball, in which case we might see him out once. He was on Toronto last year, was cut, played on American Tornado for like a month in Contenders, and then was re-signed. Again, I don't seem him playing much, but I guess it's whatever.

I expect Toronto to be somewhere around the middle of the pack, duking it out with teams like Boston, Houston, London, and Paris.

## 17 Seoul Dynasty

Flip a fuckin' coin. Heads is good Seoul, tails is bad Seoul. Such is the way of the Dynasty.

Seoul entered the league in season one with some of the highest expectations of any team in the league, with many analysts predicting them to win it all. They came in with the core of the Lunatic-Hai roster, which had incredible success in APEX pre-Overwatch League, along with Fleta who was a DPS player so powerful he had the Fleta Deadlift named after him, which is when you get over half of your team's eliminations in a match that you win. It basically means you're a superstar on a dogshit team.

Anyway, they massively disappointed and finished eighth. Season two, they overhauled the roster, ending up with an A team and a B team under KDG. Nobody knows what happened, they were incredibly inconsistent and weren't able to do very much.

Enter season three, they somewhat overhauled the roster. Fleta departs and they bring in the core of the old London Spitfire roster from season one in Gesture, Profit, and Bdosin. They wildly pendulum between being a top two and bottom two team, taking Shanghai to seven maps in the May Melee in one week and getting dumpstered by Chengdu the next.

Well, this year is looking like more of the same. FITS and Profit are joined by Saebyeolbe from New York on DPS. Marve1 and Gesture serve as dual main tanks, with Toyou being demoted to a two-way contract and then re-promoted to the main roster on off tank. I swear to fucking God if they play Marve1 on off tank again on anything but Sigma I'm going to scream.

Creative is the sole flex support, and Tobi is out at main support and in comes ANAMO from New York. With the departure of Tobi, it signals the end of an era for the organization as the last piece of the former Lunatic-Hai roster fades away into the abyss. In a way, it's kind of the end of an era for Overwatch as a whole as well.

This current roster has... So much potential for not good. They're probably going to be the same as last year where they can't decide if they want to be elite or trash. I think they should go with Marve1 as their primary main tank, playing Gesture only on the roles where he really excels, to maximize their chances of success.

## 18 London Spitfire

In season one, they basically picked up two legendary Korean super teams, chopped them up, merged parts of them, and discarded the rest. They struggled to really put it together for most of the season, before they caught on fire to make an incredible playoff run which culminated in a Grand Finals victory. In season two, they struggled during the GOATs meta and were never able to display their former glory, ending the year after a very disappointing season in the first round of playoffs.

For season three, it was rumored that Cloud9, who owns but does not operate the team, was looking to sell their franchise slot. In the end, they elected to jettison their former roster, most of it landing in Seoul, and pick up a bunch of relative unknown, unproven Korean players. And also Glister, who everyone rated as one of the best DPS players available. No idea why.

They were okay in their first two showings in NA before COVID happened and they eventually made the transition to Asia, where they languished at the bottom of the table, being kicked and stepped on repeatedly. I think they were actually okay and just kind of got fucked by a strong region. Had they been in NA, they probably would have been middle of the pack.

Well, London has decided to move in a new direction. Last year's roster is out, and they've taken their academy team, the British Hurricane, who has always been a European roster but bafflingly with an all Korean Overwatch League team that meant that they had no upward mobility within the organization and would have to go elsewhere to find a position in the Overwatch League. For the last year in Contenders EU, the Hurricane have been dominant, and picking up a roster with established synergy and teamwork has a lot of benefits.

To that core roster, they've made some choice additions, most notably in Shax from the former Valiant roster, as well as blase from Houston. Shax was a massive pick up, and was a lot of the X-factor that this roster would have otherwise lacked, doing a lot to fill the gap left as they wait for SparkR to turn 18 to be eligible to play.

Despite being a brand new roster, I have decently high hopes, and think they could be a good team even if they struggle to find wins during the season. The core of British Hurricane that makes up the tank and support line of London have already proven that they can play, granted at the Contenders level rather than OWL, but even so I think they should be around league average in terms of their strength, and with an upgraded DPS roster, I think this team could definitely pull off a few upsets this season.

## 19 Paris Eternal

Paris has taken the same but different approach to London. After building a mixed Korean-French team last year that actually found an incredible amount of success under the tutelage of Rush from Element Mystic and NineK from Crusty's Coaching Academy, managing to win the Summer Showdown with a narrow victory over Philadelphia, they elected to compound on their success by blowing it the fuck up.

The Korean core, along with head coach Rush was sold to Hastr0 over in Dallas to become the Dallas Element Mystic Fuel, and NineK departs to replace KDG in Philly. This much, I understand, I really do. I get it, 2020 with COVID was a hard year for some billionaires and companies that own teams in esports and so they're looking to cut costs this year and as a result some questionable roster moves get made, so I understand wanting to offload the high value Korean talent that you had off the back of a good year from them when their stonks should be high.

What I don't get, and what was the most controversial thing about Paris this off season, was that they also chose to dump their very solid core of French players that actually saw significant playtime last year. FDGod left for Shock, so I don't blame them for not holding on to him, but letting go of SoOn, BenBest, and NiCOgdh strikes me as questionable, especially since they're French and they were good. NiCOgdh and BenBest probably couldn't have been too expensive because they haven't managed to make it back into the league and are now down in Contenders, while SoOn was signed to Boston. Anyway, they picked up a smattering of European players, but not an established team like did London.

Daan will play main tank, ELLIVOTE comes in at off tank, with Kaan and neptuNo in the back line, neptuNo serving as the token veteran on this squad. Naga steps up from Contenders after a solid performance on Obey Alliance, same for Kaan actually, which are the most notable Contenders players on the roster. ELLIVOTE had some time in the League on the Justice before he was dropped, and he looked eh. To be fair, his main tank in r0ar was kind of feeding and team morale was boomed in the first two weeks.

I'm not quite sure about Daan, as he didn't have a ton of success in EU Contenders before he joined Revival in NA, and I would probably rank Hadi as pretty handily above him, and I would like to see the team reunite LullSiSH and ELLIVOTE if it's not working out. Kaan is cracked, as is Naga, and ONIGOD comes in after a very good performance on the Fuel after he came in to attempt to fill Decay's shoes, popping off even on 200 ping. To round out the DPS line, they bring in Tsuna as their token French player, who had two mediocre weeks on the rebuilt Titans before Shockwave came in and he was banished to the bench. He's coming in, presumably as a Tracer specialist, and I wouldn't expect to see him that often.

Head coach GetAmazed has a task ahead of him. Poor AVALLA built in an incredible roster last year, was made to rip it apart with her own two hands, and then do it again with a box of pennies. At one point this off season, AVALLA was literally the ONLY PERSON ON STAFF. Hopefully she gets a raise.

## 20 Los Angeles Valiant

So this is the only team that I placed very deliberately. The rest were in no particular order and were written as I thought of them when I attempted to list all of the teams.

The Valiant were the first team I thought of, and I intentionally put them at number 20. Number 20, where everyone is going to put them in their power rankings, and yet still more than they deserve.

It's no secret that Immortals Gaming Club, the parent organization that owns the Los Angeles Valiant and their roster spot, wants out of esports. CEO Ari Segal has decided that it's not profitable (which it isn't) and has decided that his organization is going to make the worst, messiest exit from all of the scenes they're involved in as possible.

In 2019, they acquired Infinite Esports & Entertainment, then parent company of OpTic Gaming to acquire both their League of Legends and Call of Duty League franchise slots, which also left them with the Houston Outlaws which the league mandated they sell. A mere year later after terrible showings by both their new rosters and after cost cutting measures to the Valiant that saw popular pieces sold off and unknown rookies picked up (which actually ended up being successful thanks to a good head coach in Packing10 who was then made to split duties between Overwatch and Valorant for one salary), they've apparently just given up.

A few months ago, they set the competitive Overwatch scene ablaze with the rumor by well known leaker Halo Of Thoughts that they had sold the Los Angeles Valiant to an unknown Chinese organization. They then had the gall to quote Tweet him and reply, AND I QUOTE "We would like to confirm that this rumor is false. IGC will continue to own the LA Valiant, and we are excited about the opportunity to grow the brand's global reach this year."

This came after Halo's report, after which they issued a statement that they were moving to compete in Asia this season, and then issued that statement saying they would retain ownership of the team. All of this was the same day within the span of like four hours. Halo also indicated that the new owners would be dumping the roster to have a more Chinese focused roster. After the Valiant said Halo's report was false, he quote Tweeted that Tweet and doubled down.

Fifteen days later, on January 29th, the Valiant issued the following statement: "We want to thank all the players and staff moving on today from the LA Valiant due to COVID-related visa issues, as we prepare to compete in China this season. We've worked to facilitate the best available next steps for our players and staff and wish them all the best moving forward. We look forward to having LA Valiant join NYXL and the Philadelphia Fusion in bringing more live Overwatch League content to the passionate fan base in Asia during this logistically challenging year."

A month later, on February 20th, they Tweeted "As reported, we're happy to confirm that the LA Valiant's operating partner for the 2021 season is LGE, who won the 2019 Overwatch Contenders China title. We look forward to working with them this year, and to a great 2021 season."

So let's recap. These fucking scumbags call out a leaker/reporter (his role in the community is kind of weird) saying that his report is false. It turns out to be false with a big asterisk in that the report is actually 90% true, with the only difference being IGC hangs on to the piece of paper that says the Valiant are still theirs.

In the weeks following the meltdown, we now know that, no, they in fact did not take any steps to facilitate the best available next steps for anyone, because the players found out that they no longer had a job from Halo's Tweet. I'm sure the IGC would have told the players before going public, but clearly the plan the entire time was never to retain any of the roster and simply dump them after almost every other team in the league had already finalized their own rosters, giving them minimal chances at employment. Now, some of them have managed to find spots on other rosters, specifically Shax, KSP (now Kai), and Lastro (sex big dick).

If this was going to be the plan all along, none of the players should have been signed or re-signed in the first place.

This whole situation sets a bad precedent for the League, and they absolutely took advantage of the increased flexibility that's been granted to teams during COVID in order to do something they otherwise wouldn't have been able to get away with. At any rate, what did they pick up, because they're still contractually obligated to field a team, though I guarantee you they wouldn't if they weren't.

This roster is fucking trash.

I don't want to blame the players for the sins of their parent organization, but this roster is not one that is meant to succeed in anyway. It's actually so fucking bad.

Krystal, who notoriously flamed out on the Spark mid-season after he convinced them to fly him back to China from LA because his mother was sick and who proceeded to disappear and ignore all attempts by the team to contact him when they discovered he had lied to go spend time with his girlfriend and was later sued by the Spark, SOMEHOW weasles his way back onto a roster as the hitscan player. Joining him on DPS is MoLanran, who is regarded to be 'okay.' At tank, they have Silver3 and ShowCheng, neither of which are highly rated by anyone.

They also have NvM (Nevermore) on the roster, a person who HASN'T PLAYED COMPETITIVELY SINCE 2018. The general theory here being he was actually signed as a coach but listed on the roster because the minimum number of players you can have on a roster is seven, and IGC didn't want to actually pay for both an assistant coach and a player. For support, they have wya who played one map on the Charge in 2019 and Highbee, a fucking tank player on main support.

The Valiant are so shit, and so cheap, they couldn't even sign any good players that remain in Chinese Contenders. It was rumored they were picking up an actual main support player but the deal fell through because his contract with his current team had a buyout the team was unwilling to pay. Meanwhile, Diya refused to join the team because he thought they would be so fucking bad it would bring back some kind of PTSD memories from his time on 0-40 Shanghai and boom him out of competitive Overwatch forever.

Superich also allegedly declined to join the team, another highly rated main support in Chinese Contenders. The fact that they actually put a coach on this roster with no intention of ever playing him should say it all. They wanted the absolute bare minimum for the Valiant, with no intention of winning anything.

If this is how an organization wants to treat their players and their franchise, they should just go. I firmly believe that Overwatch 2 _must_ launch before OWL Season 5, and OWL S5 must start on Overwatch 2. The value of Overwatch League teams will probably be at their highest as eager investors look to ride the hype wave. Immortals Gaming Club should sell the Los Angeles Valiant before next season.

They have no fans, everybody is now furious with them, and their roster sucks. Next season, they would move back to the US anyway and pick up a new roster, so they might as well just get out and let the new organization do whatever they want, because IGC doesn't want to be here. If I was a player, I wouldn't take an offer from IGC unless it was my last resort.

Fuck Immortals Gaming Club.

# Conclusion

And this concludes a very short and succinct summary of my thoughts all all twenty Overwatch League rosters. Now I shall begin my detailed analysis of each roster.
