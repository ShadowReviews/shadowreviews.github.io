## Hey Google, what happened?

# Unboxing

After they were announced in October, I’ve been searching at least once a day for news about Google’s next attempt into the wireless earbuds market after their ill-received first. I was concerned about some things after more announcements came about features, but after watching almost every review that was available on launch day, I ordered a pair and received them on Saturday. In the box you get the case with the buds inside, a little plastic thingy with the small and large eartips inside, a USB A to C cable, and piece of paper that I never bothered taking out of the box. Probably instructions or warranty info or something.

When you flip the case open a prompt immediately appeared on my Pixel 3a XL to pair to the Pixel Buds, which I tapped and they were connected. There’s a little setup thing kind of like the one you get when you first setup some Android phones where it tells you to take them out of the case, now put them in your ears, etc.

After that was over, I played some music and my heart dropped as everything sounded super tinny and hallow. Switching out the eartips for the larger size resolved this and the day was saved. So what are they like beyond the first five minutes?

# Look/Feel

They look pretty good. I’m not really a style person, but they’re low-profile and don’t have the dumbass stem dangling out the bottom like the Airpods and Chinese knock-off Airpods. The case isn’t too big or heavy, the matte finish on the outside feels great and the action of opening and closing the lid feels fantastic.

The Buds themselves really aren’t comfortable though. Maybe I’m just not used to them, but these aren’t something I would want to wear for hours and hours on end. A few hours, probably, but not indefinitely. It’s not painful to have them in, but there’s something about the way that they sit in my ears that just doesn’t feel correct. That said, there’s very little chance of them falling out, with the little spike sticking out the top doing an admirable job of securing them in your ears. It’s actually not the thorn that’s the comfort problem, but they push on the little sticky-out part of the ear for me which doesn’t feel great after a few minutes, so I find myself constantly fiddling with them and trying to readjust them which means I’m always inadvertently pausing, skipping, changing volume, or activating the Assistant. This is the only major issue that I have that might be “get used to”-able.

Another problem, probably the biggest problem is the “spatial vent”. We’ll get to this one later, believe me. Google says its designed to let air flow into your ear to alleviate the pressure of having your ears plugged. Probably fine in theory, but when you’ve worn earbuds that do plug your ears literally forever, these ones always feel like they aren’t actually in, even when they are, making them just feel wrong when they’re in your ears. Along with all of the other problems that cutting a hole in your earbuds introduces like meaning you have ZERO sound isolation what-so-ever. We’ll get to that. It gets its own section.

# Sound

Once I had the proper size of eartip things on the end to seal my ear-hole, they sound fine. I’m not going to talk about “soundstages” or “warm” and “cold” because I don’t know what the fuck that means, but they sound fine. My music sounds like how I would expect it to sound, nothing is really muddled, and the amount of bass is, once again, fine. If you’re used to the super over-tuned bassy sound of Beats it’ll probably sound lacking.

Thanks to the spatial vent though, making any kind of meaningful comparison to how these sound versus anything else is impossible. The best I can say is that you’re probably not going to vomit when you listen to your favorite song. When we factor in the vent and the hiss (we’ll get there, I swear) I actually wanted to reach for my $40 pair of Soundpeats Q-30 Plusses that I’ve been using since my original Q-30’s up and died. That’s definitely not what you want from your $170 flagship earbuds.

# Functionality/Features

Some of the more exciting features for me were mostly just a side effect of having more modern Bluetooth headphones. Instead of having to open the Bluetooth menu on my phone, tap on my earbuds, then tap disconnect, THEN open Bluetooth settings on my laptop to connect to the Pixel Buds, I can just connect directly to them from my laptop and they’ll automatically disconnect from my phone and then to the laptop. Nice, but not really revolutionary. They also have in-ear detection that can pause whatever you’re listening to once a Bud is removed after about a two second delay. Surprisingly, this also worked on Windows.

Being able to independently use either earbud for playback while leaving the other in the case is also great along with both sides having the exact same gestures to play, pause, skip, rewind, and adjust the volume. I can use whatever hand is free, or just whichever one I want. Or if both my hands are occupied, I can also make myself look thoroughly insane by talking to the Buds. Having the Google Assistant inside of your ear listening at all times is pretty useful, even though it sounds thoroughly dystopian. Whatever the Assistant can do, the Buds can do. It only works when connected to an Android device, so I can’t tell it to lower the volume when connected to my laptop, which I wasn’t really expecting to work anyways.

It is useful, but as someone who doesn’t use the Google Assistant for very much, she’s effectively just another way of playing/pausing and controlling the volume. She can read your notifications but the way they have it structured it takes her significantly longer to read something like a text than it would to look at my watch or phone instead. Still, if your hands are occupied she can still perform the task adequately.

Something that a lot of the mainstream tech reviewers have harped on would be the battery life, with most outlets putting it between 3 and 5 hours outside of the case before you need a top up, with a few full charges of the buds per charge of the case. Most of them say that battery life is too short, but to me personally I don’t think it’s that much of a deal. Like I said, these aren’t super comfortable to wear so after three hours I would probably want to take them out to let them charge a bit anyway, and according to Google you can get 2 hours of listening time off a ten minute nap in the charging case, so I feel like most people won’t be too limited by the battery.

# The Incredible Electronic Hiss

The review has probably sounded mediocre to negative by this point. I do actually really like these earbuds, except for the things I don’t, and the things I don’t like are pretty much instant deal-breakers.

The first is the electronic hissing noise. A few reviews have mentioned this, and either my right earbud is defective or they were all half-deaf. As someone who always uses wireless earbuds/headphones, I was expecting this and thought it would be a total non-issue. Basically, in order to conserve power wireless audio sources usually turn themselves off after a few seconds without anything to play. Between stopping audio and the device turning off, there is usually a faint, but noticeable, static hum. The Bluetooth adapter I use for my headphones on my computer do this, as do my Q-30s. The Pixel Buds also do this, and from the left side it’s almost imperceptible, with the hum being so incredibly faint that I can only hear it in a very quiet room.

The right earbud is an angry cat hissing in my ear CONSTANTLY. When connected to my laptop, it never actually stops. It is a very audible and very irritating, high-pitched electronic hissing sound. It’s so bad that when I was having my coffee and watching some YouTube videos before pausing that to do some work, I had to rip the right earbud out after a minute or so because once again, the hiss never stopped.

On a phone, the hiss does eventually stop when the earbuds turn off, but it’s no less annoying or quieter than it is on my computer. It’s so loud, in fact, that even when listening to music and medium to high volume it can still be heard. During a quiet part of a song, or listening at low volume, it utterly annihilates the listening experience. I tried to listen to Time at 3 a.m. while lying in bed, which is the quietest environment I’ll be able to muster, and the hiss was overpowering. For the first and last fifteen seconds it was all I could focus on. I’ve never experienced anything this bad, not even with my budget Q-30s which cost a full $130 less than the Pixel Buds.

Most reviewers that mentioned this issue treated it as though it wasn’t a big deal. If this is what they were experiencing, I don’t know what the hell is wrong with them. There is a distinct possibility that this is a hardware issue specific to my pair, but if it isn’t and this is a known behavior, it’s absolutely unacceptable.

# The Spatial Vent

I don’t actually remember if the spatial vent was talked about on stage when the Pixel Buds (2) were announced, or if it was something else after it that first mentioned the “spatial vent,” I thought it was a horrible idea and something that I wouldn’t like.

Guess what?

I fucking detest it. It is this frankly baffling decision from Google that renders this product utterly useless to me. The spatial vent is basically a hole that they cut in the underside of each bud that allows ambient sound as well as air to flow into the buds to help alleviate the feeling of having your ears plugged. I already mentioned how that makes them feel wrong to wear, but I just don’t understand why Google bills this as a feature.

If you’re someone who does a lot of walking around in a city and feel worried that you’re always about to be run over or something, sure, this could be a feature. Other earbuds do something similar where they use microphones positioned on the outside of the device in order to introduce some outside sound in while still sealing your ear. Google’s approach to doing this is horrible though, because when you DO want to block out everything in the outside world, you can’t.

The Pixel Buds provide possibly the worst sound isolation I’ve ever heard, potentially even worse than the earbuds of decades long ago that came with phones for free. Standing in my bathroom with the fan on, which is a very quiet fan, the Buds reduce the noise of the fan by maybe 10% maximum. With my old earbuds, I would usually have the volume at around half without being able to hear really anything else in the world. With the Pixel Buds, it can be all the way up and still feel way too quiet. This hole means that the outside world can come right on in while your music leaks straight out the bottom, with the worst sound leak I’ve ever heard, by far.

If you wanted to listen to a podcast on the noisy subway, you literally just can’t. You could crank the volume all the way up and the voices would still probably be lost in the outside noise. If you wanted to bring these on a plane, there is a 0% chance that you would be hearing anything you want to hear, even at 100% volume. If you’re in the car with your mother and don’t want to listen to her horrible music, you’re shit out of luck.

I bought these fully expecting that this “feature” could be a deal-breaker for me, but I honestly didn’t think it could possibly be this bad. It’s hard to properly express just how much I dislike this, but to me I use earbuds when I want to hear one thing and don’t want to hear anything else. The Buds are not capable of doing this, so to me they’re basically worthless.

For some, this could very well be a feature, being able to keep tabs on the world around them while also listening to some music or an audiobook or whatever, but the fact that Google hasn’t given you the ability to actually block off the outside world is insane. In order to just cover up the sound of a sink when doing the dishes and listening to a podcast, I had to turn the volume all the way up and still strain to make out words in some cases. As I’m wearing them right now, listening to a podcast, with the volume at about 75% I can hear the kitchen sink thirty feet away around a wall.

# Conclusion

There’s a lot to like about the Pixel Buds, and using these has convinced me that I do need to get a pair of truly wireless earbuds. Between the hissing sound and pathetic sound isolation, these aren’t it, especially at this price. I walked into another room and came back and now they aren’t playing audio even though they’re connected to my phone.

It’s just unfortunate because when I look around, I just see more imperfect options. Airpods don’t work well on Android, and there’s no way in hell I’m buying Airpods. The messaging around the Galaxy Buds Plus and their multi-point support is confusing so I might be back to disconnecting from each device before reconnecting with those and have a poor IPX2 rating. The Jabra Elite Active 75t’s have noise cancelling but only allow you to use the right earbud independently while I always use the left. Sony’s WF-1000XM3 look massive with a similarly massive case and no IP rating.

Should you buy them? I don’t care. It’s your money. If you’re on the fence and the spatial vent is concerning to you, no. No you absolutely should not. It is so much worse than you think it will be. If you do have a persistent fear of being run over when walking around in public, still maybe not. You might be better of going for something else than blocks out all noise and then allows you to chose how much noise you want to let filter in.

Honestly, it’s heart-breaking. The Assistant integration, look, and feel are so good that these could have been fantastic earbuds. They’re not. At least, not for me. For me they happen to trip on their ability to remove the outside world, which is the most important feature.

Goddammit, Google.

Also the fucking hissing noise. This cannot be normal.
