# Overwatch, A History
<br>
## Development
In 2007, a small team of Blizzard elites began working on a brand new IP. Later described as a "Top Secret" and "Next-Gen" project, the team continued working in relative secrecy with very little, if any, information being released to the media about such a huge project from one of the most adored studios of the age.

In 2010, a leaked internal development schedule of the next few years revealed the first information about the title. *Titan* was targeting a Q4 2013 release date. The team continued to toil away in the shadows, and in a 2011 interview then Blizzard COO Paul Sams said their long term vision was for the project to "still be growing strong" in 10, 15, or 20 years, having "set a new mark in the industry."

By 2012, the development team had grown to over 100 people and Vice President of game design, Rob Pardo, said *Titan* was "in the middle of development" and was a "very big project that's got a long ways to go."

On May 28, 2013, media leaks reported that the project had been internally rebooted. Nearly 70% of the team was moved to other projects. Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime stated in an interview they were in the process of selecting a new direction for the project, however, the project had already been cancelled in the minds of everyone at Blizzard. In a later interview on September 23, 2014 Blizzard's *Project Titan* was officially confirmed to be cancelled by Morhaime.

*Titan* was not the cover name for Overwatch during its development as you might have been led to believe. *Titan* was a "Next-Gen *MMO*" project from Blizzard, one with a six year, extremely troubled development cycle. One that was cancelled after an estimated $50 million in development costs, because according to Morhaime the team failed to control the scope of the game.

It was supposed to be a "massive multiplayer PC game in which players could both maintain non-combat professions and shoot their way through death-matches on a sci-fi version of Earth." However, with scope creep and the per-character skill tree, the game ended up with overpowered combinations of characters and abilities that left the game in a state that the game's director, Jeff Kaplan, described as being "very cluttered and confused." Ultimately, the team wasn't able to make it work, and wasn't able to find the fun. Despite the massive amount of investment, the game was smothered, and marked one of Blizzard's biggest failures.

At the time of the 2013 report, and the internal cancellation, there were about 140 members of the *Titan* team. Afterwards, 40 remained under director Jeff Kaplan and creative director Chris Metzen and given six weeks to come up with a new idea before they were moved.

The team first pitched *Crossroads*, an MMO set in an outpost in space that would have been a "crossroads" of many different alien species. They planned up to 50 distinct classes that players would be able to choose. Metzen noted they were starting to repeat the mistakes of *Titan*, and instead decided to make a first-person shooter in the vein of Team Fortress 2 while taking inspiration from popular MOBAs of the time like League of Legends and DOTA 2.

The initial pitch was a success, taking place on Temple of Anubis -- a map initially developed for *Titan* -- and featuring only a single character: Tracer. The pitch proved the mechanical design of the game worked, and the team of 40 started working on what would eventually become Blizzard's fourth, and arguably largest, IP -- *Overwatch*.

Development continued, with Overwatch being officially announced at BlizzCon on November 7, 2014. A demo was available for the attendees featuring 14 playable characters. In December, Blizzard began releasing introduction videos to each of the characters. In May 2015, there were weekly gameplay videos and character highlights. A closed beta ran from October 27, 2015 to mid-December and eventually re-opened in February 2016.

On May 5, 2016 Overwatch was made available to the world with an open beta, which was played by over 9.7 million players across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. Overwatch would release three weeks later, on May 24, 2016. Critically acclaimed, it sold *massive*, and won numerous game of the year awards as well as awards for design and gameplay. This was only the beginning, and surely it was only up from here.

<br>

## From Release to a Day in November
Overwatch continued to remain massive for years, as one of the most popular, profitable, and played multiplayer games in the industry. Content updates were slow, but generally high quality when they did hit. The first new hero, Ana, released on July 19, 2016 with the first map of Eichenwalde on September 1 of the same year.

Over the course of the next few years, the team would release maps such as Horizon Lunar Colony, Junkertown, Blizzard World, Rialto, Busan, Paris, and Havana which released on May 7, 2019.

Heroes were Sombra, Orisa, Doomfist, Moira, Brigitte, Wrecking Ball, Ashe, Baptiste, Sigma, and finally -- Echo on April 14, 2020.

On November 1, 2019, Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan took to the stage and confirmed the leaks that had surfaced days previously -- Overwatch 2 was coming. He said that the game would maintain a "shared multiplayer environment" and would dramatically expand the franchise's story and PvE offerings.

Then, there was silence.

<br>

## Departure of Jeff Kaplan
On April 20, 2021, in a 99 word statement posted to the Overwatch website, Jeff Kaplan announced he was leaving Blizzard.

A career that had started in 2002 as a quest designer on World of Warcraft from connections formed in an EverQuest guild under the alias "Tigole" ended suddenly, with a brief statement, in the middle of an already obviously troubled development cycle for the successor to one of the industry's juggernauts.

It was a huge blow to the Overwatch community, because in every sense of the word, Jeff was the *face* of Overwatch. He wasn't simply the director, he was Papa Jeff. He was the one who sat on a stool somewhere in the Blizzard campus and spoke unprompted and unscripted about the team's vision for the game for ever major change, new hero, and new map.

He was the Papa Jeff who sat in a brown leather chair in front of a roaring fire every year for the 10 hour Yule Log video, opening presents and talking about the development of the game, or just simply staring into the camera, unmoving.

He was, to many, one of the people who made Overwatch what it was. And now, he was gone, with the future of Overwatch being anything but certain.

<br>

## The Great Silence
After the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, and the release of the first game's final hero in April of 2020, there was silence.

No news, no updates, no chats with Jeff. Just... Nothing. Then when Jeff left in 2021, and a brief update from the new director, Aaron Keller, there was silence once again. For months, no information at all, despite assurances from Keller the team wanted to and would do a better job communicating with the playerbase in the future.

In the absence of any new content, Overwatch -- which had already been waning in popularity at the time of Overwatch 2's announcement -- well and truly began to wilt. At the Overwatch League Grand Finals in Hawaii on September 25, 2021, Keller joined the Watchpoint Desk for an awkwardly placed half-time intermission in the series between the Shanghai Dragons and Atlanta Reign.

The segment, which lasted just shy of half an hour, featured a show match of players from eliminated teams on a pre-Alpha build of Overwatch 2. It introduced changes to Sombra and Bastion, and was the only scrap of information about the game that had been provided since Keller's update in April, and would remain the only scrap of information until the Overwatch League started spinning up again in March of 2022, this time playing on a beta version of Overwatch 2 instead of a finished game.

<br>

## Lawsuit and the Summer of 2021
After already a year of no new content, no updates, and no release window, players were already on edge and frustrated with Blizzard and their lack of updates. When Kaplan departed suddenly in early 2021, it seemed to truly be the darkest day of Overwatch. Unfortunately, it had yet to come.

On July 21, 2021 the State of California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard after a two year investigation by the agency. The lawsuit alleges a culture of discrimination and harassment towards female employees that had gone unaddressed for years.

Activision Blizzard and CEO Bobby Kotick dismissed the allegations and provided a series of statements that served to enrage the media and gaming community, rather than make the problem go away, as was clearly intended.

It was a social and media firestorm that saw the company's stock tank, mass walk-outs, and soon mass departures from the company. Several insiders allege that Blizzard's Team Four, responsible for the development of Overwatch and Overwatch 2, were largely fine and shielded from the rest of the company by Kaplan, but many key staffers on the team still left the project, resulting in even further development setbacks.

As of writing, the suit is still on-going.

<br>

## Beta, Again
Finally, after two years with no significant updates to Overwatch, an invitation-only beta for Overwatch 2 was launched on April 26, 2022. This gave players access to many reworked and re-balanced heroes, one new hero, one new game mode, and a few new maps, and of course the first taste of the new 5v5 future for the game.

A second beta was run in July which introduced another hero and one additional map. Each beta ran for a little over two weeks and served as the first concrete *anything* the team had to show for the new game since its announcement that fateful November day in 2019.

<br>
# Gameplay

Now that we have a fairly comprehensive history of the game, let's actually review it. Sort of.

<br>

## Heroes
The heroes are Overwatch. It is the single most fundamental component of the gameplay, and it is the game's identity and soul. Without the heroes, this game is nothing.

Each hero has a unique kit, playstyle, and aesthetic. There are a few archetypes that the heroes fit in, and they fit into one of three categories. However, there's no instance in which two characters are perfectly interchangeable. Sometimes characters can do *similar* things, but there's no instance in which you can just swap one character out for another to achieve the same result without having to change something else.

Each hero has a normal attack, two to four(ish) abilities, and an ultimate. It can be kind of hard to pin down an exact number on abilities, because some characters have a different jump, which isn't really listed on their ability page but still sort of is. You can also make the argument that Echo has all of her own abilities plus everyone else's since she can duplicate every other character in the game.

The reason Overwatch got so popular initially is because the gameplay was refined, and the characters were fun to play. It was an enhancement of the TF2 formula where each hero was distinct in the way that it played, but there was more of them and their abilities were far larger in scope. The different abilities could be used in synergy with your own team or to counter the enemy team, which added another layer that would become the foundation for the highest levels of competitive play.

As a result of this complexity, though, the game became difficult to balance. Initially nobody noticed, because the game was so new that nobody had yet solved it. The truly broken compositions hadn't been discovered, and rigid METAs wouldn't truly start to develop for about a year after the game's release with the introduction of the Tracer-Genji dive composition that dominated early Overwatch e-sports.

With time, those difficulties began to surface which culminated in the GOATs composition. Consisting of three tank and three support heroes, it dominated all levels of competitive play from September 2018 until the 2-2-2 role-lock was introduced in the summer of 2019. Developers claimed limiting teams to picking two tank, DPS, and support characters (as the game had initially been intended) gave them more flexibility to balance.

Unfortunately, this proved to be anything but a silver-bullet to solve all the game's problems. The balance and development cadence from the team was still extremely slow, with months passing between balance changes at times. This led to the game stalling out and starting to drive some players away.

This ended up being a problem that Team Four never really managed to fix. After they stopped adding new content to the game, they promised more rapid balance updates. They did, for a while, until they stopped doing those too. Preferring instead to just let the game die while they worked on Overwatch 2.

Despite these problems, the distinctive gameplay offered by each character remains the reason to actually play Overwatch. It's not Valorant, which is basically CS:GO with some abilities, but the primary focus being gun-play. It's more like a fast-paced FPS crossed with a MOBA, where managing your abilities effectively is huge to how successful you're going to be.

<br>

## Maps and Modes
The maps look amazing, but are fairly pedestrian. Each map has a strong sense of identity and great theming, with small narrative bits woven throughout, but that doesn't always translate to something that plays well. They're all fairly linear, which makes them read relatively easily, but with a heavy reliance on chokepoints to force desired gameplay effects out of players.

In some instances, this leads to maps being incredibly unbalanced where one team just has to throw themselves at a small chokepoint over and over again until they eventually get through. The worst example of this being Paris, which was so detested it was quickly removed from competitive play, and years later removed from the game entirely -- along with Horizon Lunar Colony.

There's only four modes in Overwatch -- King of the Hill (Control), 2CP (Assault), Hybrid which sees players capture a control point and then push a cart, and Escort which sees players push a cart to the end of the map. The gamemodes have to be relatively straightforward, because the average gamer isn't very smart, but after six years they do start to get a little stale, especially when you haven't had a new map in three and a half years (yes, really).

The maps have always had a much smaller effect on the way the game is played than everyone would have liked. The intention from the developers is that the game would be balanced in such a way that there is no strongly defined META, but rather there are strategies and compositions that differ per map. Very rarely has this actually ended up being the case, though. In most instances, there is a combination of heroes that's so powerful you run it on every map.

Still, the maps are overall decent, with only a few particularly bad ones that would sometimes see a 400% turnover rate each game. Looking at you, Paris.

<br>

## Ranked vs Quickplay
When Overwatch launched, there was no such thing. There was just "play." Eventually the Competitive mode was added. It was already in the game, just locked for a period of time as everyone got settled.

Now, they're two distinct modes. Both feature skill based match-making (Call of Duty players in shambles) with competitive mode showing you your rank and allowing you to measure your progression. The only gameplay difference is that competitive games are longer, with each team having the chance to both attack and defend on every game mode except Control. Streamers by and large play competitive exclusively, whereas I've always played quick play.

In quick play, toxicity is fairly rare, though you will have a bunch of shitters throw your game pretty regularly by playing weak heroes, or just being bad. However, the games are pretty short that you can just load up into the next one... as long as you're not a DPS player. The introduction of the tank, DPS, and support queue also saw the introduction of queue times, something that they have struggled to manage ever since and only exacerbated in both recent betas for Overwatch 2.

Still, as someone who is extremely non-competitive, I kick back with a video on another monitor and shit on some kids in quick play, and if things go bad I just fire into the next game. I have played competitive a little, but have found it to generally be a less enjoyable experience.

<br>

## Story Events
Another element of the game is the "seasonal" events that they started running with the 2016 Summer Games, an in-game event that ran alongside the 2016 Olympic Games and featured themed skins, sprays, voice lines, and a soccer minigame.

Now there's various different events throughout the year, with some of them introducing the games only PvE content in the form of "missions." The first to be introduced was the Halloween Event in 2016 with Junkenstein's Revenge, which pits four players up against a horde of Zombified Omnic robots to defend a small portion of Eichenwalde in several waves, lasting about ten minutes per game.

There were other events that introduced "canonical" gameplay events that fit into the actual narrative of the universe, but these all consisted of existing mechanics of the game disguised on very slightly modified multiplayer maps, maybe with new skins for the characters and some mission specific dialogue.

In all, they're kind of nothing. They're the closest you can get to literally nothing while still having what is technically something, but the lack of attention given to the single-player or PvE experience was always a pretty significant point of contention amongst the community, and something that is allegedly being addressed with Overwatch 2. If and when it ever releases.

Not helping is the fact that they never really introduced new ones. There were three total story events, and three or four other seasonal events, but after that they just kept running the same ones every year, which led to the joke of "Oh boy, I can't wait to play Junkenstein's revenge for the sixth year!"

<br>
# Cinematics
While Overwatch doesn't have a campaign mode, it does have a universe, which was developed and explored almost entirely through other forms of media -- novels, comics, and cinematic shorts.

Blizzard has always been famous in the industry for the quality of their cinematic pieces, often being leaps and bounds ahead of what everyone else could (or would) do. In this regard, Overwatch stands above with several fantastic cinematic shorts released over the years.

I will now proceed to review all of them, individually.

Good luck, everyone else.

<br>

## Overwatch Cinematic Trailer
Released: November 7, 2014

The first short serves as the announcement trailer for the game, establishing the world and Overwatch as the sort of modern-day superhero story. It briefly describes the Omnic Crisis, how Overwatch saved the world, and finally how Overwatch collapsed and shutdown.

As two boys, a young child and his teenage brother wander the museum, Winston comes crashing through a skylight before engaging in combat with Reaper and Widowmaker as they attempt to steal Doomfist's Power Gauntlet from a display case. Tracer joins in the fight, they continue to fight while showing off some of what would become their in-game abilities, before the villains retreat and the heroes give chase.

There's not much to this one compared to many of the others, however, it does a decent job setting the tone of the narrative and the universe, as well as showing off Blizzard's then-signature animation quality. It's sort of like Saturday cartoons, but with a much higher budget and therefore refined and polished style. Not to mention competent cinematography.

Overall, it's solid but certainly doesn't stand out compared to many of the other shorts. Actually, it does stand out in one way, but that's only in the concept art and unfinished design ideas that made it in. Reaper starts shooting grenades while Widowmaker's voice actress isn't final, though she only has a single line.

This isn't super surprising though as the trailer was a year and a half before the actual launch of the game.

<br>

## Recall
Released: March 23, 2016

Recall finds Winston alone in the abandoned Overwatch Watchpoint Gibraltar, working on a prototype shield generator. After a failed test, he kicks back on his tire at the computer with some peanut butter and a banana to watch the news.

After a report about the rising Second Omnic Crisis, a frustrated Winston beings the process of recalling Overwatch. Athena, Overwatch's former AI assistant, reminds him the Petras Act declared any activity relating to Overwatch to be illegal. A resigned Winston leaves the OVERWATCH RECALL hologram up, still with the yes or no selection.

Meanwhile, Reaper and some Talon goons infiltrate the base in an attempt to steal the database containing the known locations of all remaining Overwatch agents. Winston fights them off, and after Athena reboots and the recall screen once again appears, he pushes the button to activate the recall.

This short builds on the small bit of narrative that was established in the 2014 teaser trailer, this time elevating Overwatch from "shut down" to "criminally illegal." It also sets the scene for the current events of the game, namely the Second Omnic Crisis, rather than allusions to previous events and the First Omnic Crisis.

The animation is still solid with music that triumphantly swells in all the right places. It's a good trailer to release about two months before the game and starts to build excitement in the universe and the lore.

<br>

## Alive
Released: April 5, 2016

Alive sees Widowmaker assassinate Tekhartha Mondatta, leader of the Shambali, as he gives a speech on King's Row. The Shambali Monks ponder the nature of consciousness and argue that Omnics possess souls the same as humans do, while advocating for peace between mankind and their would-be robot overlords.

Tracer attempts to fight off Widowmaker, before an insane maneuver puts Tracer in the line of fire directly between Widowmaker and Mondatta's head. Tracer recalls, removing the last remaining obstacle between the sniper and her target as she takes the shot. Mondatta is killed and Widowmaker retreats, having completed her mission.

The best short yet, by far, and one of the best overall. The cinematography is superb, with excellent movement around the environment and music. There's not a ton to say about it other than it's amazing. Everything is executed so well that it became a huge piece of marketing for the game a month before open beta began.

100% go watch it if you've never seen it. Maybe go watch it just because. It's great.

<br>

## Are You With Us?
Released: May 2, 2016

Released as the open beta was, the two minute teaser trailer also serves as the game's opening. In it, Winston attempts to find the right words to say to recall the Overwatch team, asking them to disobey the law and to try and make a difference in the world once again as it verges on the brink of all-out war for the second time in thirty years.

It starts out rather humorous, as sort of a blooper real of his attempts to record his message as the room gets darker and darker as more time passes while he struggles to get a usable take. Eventually, he instead opts to try and explain the Omnic Crisis and Overwatch's role in stopping it, before giving up.

Then, with determination he flashes a series of images of terrorist attacks, Omnic insurrections, and riots around the world and makes an impassioned plea -- "Someone has to do something... WE have to do something." then telling them that the world, despite the Petras Act and the disbanding of Overwatch, needs them now. He ends simply with "Are you with me?" as the music swells and the video cuts.

It's pretty solid, but the fact that it played every time you launched the game on console was kind of annoying and let to it being incredibly overplayed for a lot of people over the course of the last... six years. It's still good though, short, sweet, and to the point, with some emotional high and low points despite only running for about 90 seconds in total.

<br>

## Dragons
Released: May 16, 2016

Dragons tells the folktale of the two great dragon brothers -- the Dragon of the North Wind and the Dragon of the South Wind -- but also the tale of Genji and Hanzo Shimada.

I'm not really going to bother summarizing it other than to say it's amazing, go watch it. Everything about it is good, it's one of the best shorts by far. Probably the third most emotional short after Honor and Glory and The Last Bastion. That's a spoiler though, we haven't gotten there yet.

<br>

## Hero
Released: May 22, 2016

Days until release: two.

Hero tells the story of a young Mexican girl who is sent to the store to buy a bag of flour for her family's restaurant, and along the way becomes involved in a hate crime and then an act of terrorism. A group of gangsters beating an Omnic with a baseball bat steal her money and run away.

She chases them, only for Solider: 76 to show up and proceed to (non-lethally) shoot them all. Unfortunately a second truck shows up to exfiltrate the wounded and besieged gang members, who throw a grenade at to cover their escape.

A grenade which conveniently rolls right up to the girl. Soldier: 76 remains torn between saving the girl and chasing the gang. Explosion happens, but he picked girl, so she's safe. He gives her money back and she successfully purchases a bag of flour, with only about ten people having died.

This short further builds on the racial tension between the Omnics and humans, as well as the fall of Overwatch. It's not discussed in the short, other than to say that Soldier: 76 is "one of those former heroes" to which he replies "Not anymore." Of course, we now understand him to be the former leader of Overwatch, who has ended up fighting gang violence in Mexico.

Best of luck with that.

Overall, it's an alright short. The music pops off, but there's not as much to it compared to some of the others. It's pretty straight-forward world building without any of the emotional peaks of the better shorts.

<br>

## The Last Bastion
Released: August 18, 2016

Oh boy.

This is either the best short, or the second best. Sort of depends on the day. It narrowly edges out the other contender for best, Honor and Glory, in terms of views. The Last Bastion was the first short released after the game, and it blew up. At the time, Overwatch was at the absolute height of its popularity.

This short tells the story of Bastion, one of the untold thousands or millions of Bastion units in the Omnic's war machine during the first Omnic Crisis, as well as a bird -- Ganymede.

Ganymede is building a nest, and then decides to start beak-tapping some things, inadvertently reactivating a dead Bastion unit buried in mud, ivy, plants, and flowers deep in a lush German forest. Bastion awakens, and the two proceed to live happily ever after as Bastion enjoys a serene walk through the woods, discovering the wonders of nature.

Unfortunately, the reason for their walk is Bastion is still programmed to search and destroy his original target, some random German city. In a forest clearing, the two work to complete Ganymede's nest, before a woodpecker hammers into a tree, which Bastion mistakenly interprets as gunfire. In a fit of robo-PTSD, he activates turret mode and obliterates some trees in front of him.

When he regains his robo-senses, all that's left is a broken bird's nest covered in shell casings and a single yellow feather. A dejected Bastion continues towards his target, exiting the forest and locking his robo-sights on the city, on the other side of some rolling fields.

He takes a few steps forward before hitting another dead Bastion unit, the camera pans out to reveal the field scattered with remnants of the war. He taps into the memories of the Bastion unit, only to relive a brutal battle of the war as German soldiers and Crusaders desperately tried to hold the line against the advancing enemy.

After the flashback, he chambers a round and begins to march towards the city, only for Ganymede to finally catch up to him, shockingly not dead. He contemplates a lone attack on Germany, or living in the woods, eventually breaking his programming and returning to the woods with his new pet bird.

Again, this short is fantastic. It absolutely hits it out of the park in terms of visuals, music, and story. Every aspect of it is great, and it tells potentially the most story of any of the shorts without any dialogue at all. It brings the Omnic Crisis from the realm of "civil unrest, and maybe some insurrections" to an all-out war which could have been an extinction level event for either side.

Go watch this. Doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, do it again. It's less than eight minutes. It's basically just a short Pixar movie.

<br>

## Infiltration
Released: November 4, 2016

This short establishes Sombra as a character, working on her own within the Talon organization as she intentionally botches an assassination attempt on Katya Volskaya, the CEO of Volskaya Industries. It ties in with the ARG they ran back in the day, as well as her other character video in which she alludes to her own agenda rather than actually marching to the beat of Talon's drum.

The short has some decent action sequences, but is fairly forgettable. In reality, not much happens. It's just a five minute action scene, followed by a minute of not a whole lot as Kataya considers her options -- death or working with Sombra.

Can probably skip this one.

<br>

## Rise and Shine
Released: August 23, 2017

This one is just fucked up.

This one takes place at Ecopoint Antarctica. Turns out, robots weren't the only thing Overwatch was trying to fight. The Ecopoint is basically a research base where some scientists in Overwatch are studying climate change. Yep, we've reached the Singularity but still haven't figured out to build more nuclear reactors. Great.

Mei is part of the team there, and in the middle of a massive blizzard, they're cut off from supplies. As rations grow dangerously low, the research team enters cryo-sleep until such time as Overwatch is able to send supplies and some other people to dig them out of the snow. Unfortunately, while they're all asleep, Overwatch decides to collapse, so nobody comes for them or seemingly remembers them.

After 9 years in cryo-sleep, Mei finally re-awakens, only to find everyone else's pods had failed at some point and they're, like, super dead. The base is running out of power, so Mei has to do some quick engineering and through the sacrifice of her noble companion robot, Snowball, she's able to get enough signal to receive Winston's recall.

Then, with determination, she sets off to just... Walk to somewhere else. I'm not really sure where she's going. I guess some other research station, because I don't think you can walk from Antarctica to China, but honestly I'm not sure. I'm not really a map guy.

This one is pretty good, but kind of fucked up. It's a bit slow, but is very different from all the other shorts. If you're watching all the shorts, it's worth watching, but probably not worth making a trip for.

<br>

## Honor and Glory
Released: November 3, 2017

The GOAT.

In the ruins of Eichenwalde, Brigitte rants to Reinhardt about Winston's recall, telling him it's no longer his fight, especially with how the organization collapsed. All the while, Reinhardt simply stares at an Overwatch medal in his hand.

The rest of the short consists of a flashback to Reinhardt's time as a Crusader during the Omnic Crisis, under the command of General Balderich von Adler, who lead the Crusaders. Reinhardt refuses to wear a helmet, and is often charging out in front of the rest of the unit, leaving his fireteam without a shield and to fend for themselves in the midst of a battle.

After attempting to charge an OR14 Omnic and losing an eye, Reinhardt is rescued by Balderich, who is critically injured in the process. The two retreat inside the castle where Balderich orders Reinhardt to return to their team, to act as their shield, and to take his place in the yet-to-be-formed Overwatch. Originally, Balderich was called to join the organization which Reinhardt scoffs at, wondering why anyone would choose to leave the Crusaders.

Balderich fights off the invading Omnics, before collapsing into the throne at the center of the castle, where he remains forevermore. Reinhardt returns to his team, expending the last of his barrier to shield the wounded men from the marching Omnics, before shielding them with his body as a German airstrike decimates the enemy.

Smoke swirls over the castle as we cut back to the present, with Reinhardt and Brigitte standing in the throne room, Reinhardt at the throne where the armor of his friend and mentor remains sitting, untouched. He places the medal on the arm of the throne, turns and simply repeats what Balderich had said to him so many years earlier:

"I have been called. I must answer... Always."

This short is amazing. It's probably the most emotional one, and shows the transformation of Reinhardt from a reckless glory-seeker, to Overwatch's shield. The music, animation, and story are all great. The only thing that bugs me is the map geometry doesn't make any sense with some seemingly blatant continuity errors, but most people (especially those who haven't played the game) wouldn't notice.

Anyway, stop reading this and go watch Honor and Glory. Then come back to this.

Don't stop reading.

You can't escape.

## Shooting Star
Released: August 22, 2018

This one is about D.Va. A tabloid news report talks about the glamorous life-style she lives, hanging out with the latest celebrities, eating only the finest food, and drinking only the finest... drinks...

Meanwhile, she's at the MEKA base, working on her mech, eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew. D.Va is a pro-gamer, after all. She's also the last one on the squad left somewhat operational after a recent battle. Turns out, the Omnic Crisis never quite ended in Korea, with the Gwishin Omnics attacking out of an Omnium in the East China Sea. However, they attack infrequently, often years between attacks.

She and her mechanic, Dae-hyun, argue about teamwork, as D.Va insists on doing everything herself. In the middle of maintenance, more Omnics are picked up on radar. D.Va goes out to fight them alone as Dae-hyun yells over the radio to wait for reinforcements.

She fights them, things don't go well. Her mech is damaged in the process. As a last ditch resort, she overloads the reactor, bails out, and shoots the mech to blow it as she falls into the ocean, later rescued by a military (maybe coast guard) helicopter. She almost died in the process, but at least she's learned the value of teamwork.

It's eh. Probably one of the weaker ones so far. I don't have a ton to say about it, because it's pretty forgettable. None of characters are particularly interesting or noteworthy, and the story shown doesn't have much to it.

## Reunion
Released: November 2, 2018

Reunion introduces a few characters -- notably Ashe and Echo. This short premiered just a few weeks before the release of Ashe, and teased what would become the final Overwatch character in Echo. The main character of the short is the cowboy himself, McCre--uh.

Cassidy.

It's basically just a western movie cut down to seven and a half minutes, with the last thirty seconds reserved for McC--Cassidy waking up Echo and informing her of the recall. It's pretty good, but nothing exceptional or noteworthy really. It does more to tease characters than it does to build on them in any significant way. It's fine. The action sequence is decent, but not as good as one of the better shorts.

## Zero Hour
Released: November 4, 2019

Zero Hour was shown alongside the announcement of Overwatch 2 at BlizzCon 2019. In it, Winston, Mei, and Tracer go to Paris to stop an attack by Null Sector. Null Sector is basically an Omnic supremacy terrorist organization. At the time of their deployment, those three are the only ones who responded to the recall. I mean, Winston issued it, so he doesn't really count.

They try to fight off the invasion, which immediately goes poorly. Winston orders Tracer to retreat with the injured Mei, two French police officers, and the single small child they were trying to protect as he prepares to make his final stand, only for several other Overwatch members to come flying in out of nowhere to save the day as the strings section goes wild. Together, with the power of friendship, they destroy the giant laser mech and save the day.

After the battle, one of the officers asks if this means Overwatch is back. Winston confirms, they all pose, cut to black with the Overwatch logo as a 2 burns its way onto the screen and the music swells, le hooray.

This is one of the best shorts, because it's kind of cheating. It's the largest move forward in the story we've seen, establishing the fact that Overwatch is back together and ready to face the second largest threat to humanity as a species since the last one twenty years earlier. It's basically just another human-robot world war.

Anyway, the animation is slick, the music pops off, everything is good. There's nothing to not like. It came out at a time when we all had hope. We dared to hope that Overwatch 2 could be good, that it could change everything, that it could bring Overwatch from a middling shadow of its former glory to the top of the competitive gaming scene once more.

If only we had known.

## The Wastelander
Released: June 16, 2022

I had originally written that Shooting Star was the worst short, until I remembered this exists.

Relatively speaking, it came out recently, and yet I have completely forgotten all about it. I remember some of the two minute long character introduction videos better than I remember this. Speaking of which, the Sigma one is really good. Way better than this short.

That's not a good thing, considering this is the first new short in the better part of three years, the first new short since Overwatch 2 was first announced. It should be massive, and a sign that things were finally moving in the right direction -- that we might finally get Overwatch 2 afterall.

Over the past three years, there's been a lot of departures. Basically anyone who was working on story is gone, so this is the new generation's chance to show us the future of Overwatch's narrative and story telling.

And my God it's bad.

It's very different than the others, if they just wanted to try something quirky and cool, that's great, but don't do it again. At the very least, not like this. It's just bad, I don't like really anything about it. It's also problematic, because this is sort of the first at-bat we've seen for the new narrative team since they've all slowly left over the last few years. So far, it hasn't been an inspiring performance.

I won't lie, I couldn't even bring myself to go watch this one again for this review. I just skipped it. I hate it.

# Flowers for Overwatch

You might wonder when the review is happening.

Well, me too. To be honest, I don't know what this is. How do you review a live service game that's been running for six years? At that point the gameplay almost becomes secondary to its history running as a live service title.

More than anything, I think this is maybe my funeral for Overwatch, as soon it will be mercilessly smothered under the weight of corporate greed. It's a time for me to reflect and try to figure out how I feel about that when it ends up being a swirling tempest of emotions and thoughts hopelessly intermingled and congealed. Clearly, everything is all over the place. The review of the shorts was sort of a reflection of how things used to be, partially an illustration of Overwatch's troubled life, and the foreshadowing of Overwatch 2's unfortunate fate, but I don't feel like expounding upon those points anymore. Really, I'm just so... tired.

I did like Overwatch. When it first released, it was one of the biggest gaming properties, period. The shorts were popping off, merchandise was everywhere, and it absolutely dominated the front page of every porn site. I'm told. I never checked for myself. Content updates were slow, but generally high-quality and satisfying when they did arrive. Everything was pretty much fine leaving 2018 and the first season of the Overwatch League, but in 2019 things started to slowly wane as the game became more and more "solved."

There were a lot of balance issues around that time, and people gradually just moved on to other games. It's somewhat naive for developers to think that just by adding more "content" they'll be able to stop the relentless march of entropy. People will just move on. In late 2019, it really hit the fan, though we only understand that fully in hindsight. With the announcement of Overwatch 2, and that they would no longer support the existing game beyond the release of Echo and some balance patches (and a handful of new skins smattered about) Overwatch was left in an incredibly awkward state.

When every other fucking game on the planet was adopting a live-service model, one of the pioneers of the model in the AAA space was no longer live, but more like a life support model. Even still, I kept playing, because at its core, I like the game. The heroes are satisfying and I'm okay with more or less playing the same thing over and over, because I'm mostly just focused on trying to play my best game every game, which starts over every game. It's something that I can play pretty mindlessly and have a... time. Not always a good time, but I can play it and time slips away, which has some value in and of itself.

Now, after an absolute clusterfuck of a development cycle, Overwatch 2 is days away... from early access. An early access that will launch free to play, with one mode removed and one mode added with three maps for existing modes and three new characters -- actually only two unless you purchased the $40 Watchpoint pack or Overwatch 1, because otherwise Kiriko is locked behind tier 55 of the battle pass.

Disappointment is a word, I'm not sure the word is strong enough to express how I feel about it. I knew the moment they announced Overwatch 2 and how they spoke of making it like other games in the industry that the monetization would be egregious, because of course it would be. The games industry no longer has any interest in the business of making games, but the business of making monetization opportunities. They don't want to do anything to make a game more fun, they want to do anything to make a game more lucrative, more exploitive, more manipulative. They openly said they locked characters in the battle pass because that was "the most engaging 'content'".

Everything is just content now. Content shoveled out into shitty seasons designed to FOMO you into staying online. They want to lock you in, keep you in, and keep you playing. If they can just do that, they can find a way to your wallet. They'll get you somehow down the line.

None of this is new -- not really. It's, in many ways, always been like this. None of my raging against the dying of the light is going to do a damn thing to stop anything. I'm just made to sit here and watch as everything burns to the ground before me. I recognize the futility of my effort, and yet I remain. So what's the problem? Well, Overwatch 2 is shaping up to be something that is, at the core, no longer Overwatch. They're trying to de-emphasize hero swapping because they think it'll let them get away with locking heroes, something they explicitly and publicly pledged never to do when the game came out. They're moving to the seasonal battle pass model and free to play so people will never get bored because there's always "content" because for some reason now adding 80 skins, voice lines, and stickers to a game every nine weeks is considered "content." They've refocused Overwatch from a game focused on being a game to a game focused on being a battle pass with a mini-game called Overwatch to act as the vehicle to play the battle pass.

And yet there are people who leap to the defense of the billion dollar mega-corporation, far be it from me to ever manage to comprehend why. Leap to the defense of those who seek at every opportunity to exploit you, great plan. They argue that "Well, this is how the other games do it."

That's great. Not every game has to be every other game, Overwatch can be different. It can do something else, that's fine. They argue they have to do it because the game is free to play, they have to sustain development somehow. I suppose that's true but -- counterpoint -- just charge me for the game. I'll pay you money for the game and all the shit. I no longer have the energy to feel like I'm railroaded into a part-time job to keep up with the video game that's supposed to be relaxing. I'm not sure if they think they're pulling the wool over my eyes, I understand all too well what they're doing. They're not clever, they're chasing industry trends. That's clearly worked out before every time every other uninspired mega-corp has done it. Right, Anthem?

So overall, Overwatch is dying. No, not dying. It's dead, with execution scheduled for October 2nd. The last day of Overwatch before the servers are shutdown on the 3rd and transitioned over for launch on the 4th. What I'll wake up to that fateful day is a game I no longer enjoy to the same degree because of the various balance, mechanical, and ideological shifts it brings with a monetization model I find loathsomely tiring. This is the future of the industry, I suppose. We no longer want to make things fun, because nobody wants fun games anymore.

Overall, I just find it frustrating with a side of painful irony from the game that, so many years ago in a short, issued a challenge to viewers to
