## _Lara Croft: Become God_

<br>

# Overview

Chances are you've probably never heard of this game. I don't know how I originally discovered it, but I've been aware of it for quite some time now. I think it's most notable for some incredible visual teasers featuring real time ray-tracing coupled with the fact that it was made by a dude working on it in his free time from China.

The game is developed entirely by one guy, with some help on the music and potentially some modeling or assets or something. I didn't look into it that hard.

His first entry, Bright Memory, was actually something between a glorified demo and a proof-of-concept technical test, which I found out after purchasing it for $10 only to beat it in about 30 minutes. I was alright with it, however, as he guaranteed that anyone who purchased Bright Memory would also receive Bright Memory: Infinite on release for no additional charge. I bought and played the original like a week before Infinite came out without really being aware of that fact.

Anyway, it's a game. Pew pew.

# Gameplay

This is going to be probably both the shortest and hardest review I've ever written. Wink.

I don't know what the fuck this game is supposed to be. It's just bizarre.

It's like Doom, Death Stranding, Metal Gear, Ghostrunner, Tomb Raider, Call of Duty, Destiny, Devil May Cry, and Sekiro all fucked and gave birth to some awful sin of creation called Bright Memory Infinite. The game is such an absolute mish-mash of disparate ideas and mechanics. You have guns, and a sword, but the sword also has the range of a gun, and a grappling hook which doubles as a Force pull lasso thing and can also liquefy enemies using magic, and you can do combos with your gun sword guns to do things and also you can Falcon punch.

_What?_

Somehow, bafflingly, it works. Mercifully, it's in first-person instead of third. The gunplay is snappy and responsive, with each weapon feeling unique and impactful. There's only four, an assault rifle, shotgun, autopistol, and sniper rifle, each with an alternate fire mode with a separate ammo type that you can find and pick up as you move through the levels. The sword somehow feels natural to use and to combo with busts of fire from your other armaments. Instead of switching to the sword you just push 'e' to perform a melee attack, and it can also do the anime thing where it somehow compresses the air in front of it to form a ranged slashing arc... Thing. I think it's actually called a "light blade" so I guess it hardens light and fires that off. I don't know, man, it's a fuckin' sword. Swish swish stab. But also swish swish shoot.

The game plays very similarly to Doom, with various encounters sort of forcing you to switch between the different weapons, mostly because of the type of enemy that you're dealing with or, more likely, the combination of enemies. You have standard grunts with rifles and snipers and shotguns, but then there's mini-boss type dudes with big lightning staves that will basically just run at you and try to slap the shit out of you which is where the combat suddenly somehow becomes Sekiro.

Certain enemy types will have two health bars, which is basically like a hybrid of an overshield and a posture bar. They take damage much more slowly when the second bar is filled, but you'll still do damage to their true health bar by just shooting them normally. The way you break the second health bar is like breaking posture, when you deflect the incoming attack at just the right time using your sword (oh, right, there's also a block with the sword) it will briefly stagger them and deal a significant amount of damage to that bar. After their posture breaks, they take significantly more damage from your other attacks.

As for enemy types, you have all of what I already mentioned, plus when you get ripped through space time you'll be fighting ancient soldiers with poleaxes, swords, bows, and the occasional shield. The shield enemies utilize the posture mechanic, whereas everyone else just gets glacked. It is actually a decent variation in gameplay because you go from fighting ranged based enemies to melee enemies, usually in much closer quarters which sort of forces you to switch up playstyle or weaponry upon occasion.

There's also some sort of combo moves and/or power attack... Things you can do. When you hold 'e' when looking at an enemy with your sword you can do a special move that throws them up in the air and levitates them there for a few seconds, along with you, at which point you can annihilate them with your sword by repeatedly pressing 'e.' After spending an upgrade point, you can unlock a slash wave thing where you sprint and then hold 'e' to send out a wave slash that hits enemies in a cone in front of you at a fairly decent range. You can also upgrade your bionic arm attachment left hand bit to do a Falcon punch when sprinting and holding 'f' to pay respects to the enemy you're about to murder, although I mostly used that as an escape mechanism to put distance between myself and bosses.

Everything works and plays surprisingly well, but there are some rough edges. Climbing targets don't always (never) work the first time around so you end up running up to the ledge and jumping straight up and down with your face smushed against it like a moron. The hitboxes for the grapple targets are pretty small at times, but it's not really an issue since I don't recall in instance where you were actually able to use the grapple while in combat. Some enemies and bosses can stun-lock you in a way that seems unintentional because if you try to run away you sort of rubber-band back into place after a few feet until you die. Pickup hitboxes for ammo or other things on the ground are borderline microscopic and I ended up using a blast of Force push on them roughly twice every time I attempted to grab one, luckily they're not affected and just sit there. The grapple is a bit weird, in some areas of the game you have to grapple over dangerous terrain or pits or something, but if you jump forward off the ledge and then grapple you'll fall faster than you'll move forward, so you'll it it and die and then sort of grapple during the death animation, and once you get there you're still dead and have to do it again.

There's a handful of boss fights throughout the game. The fights are reasonably thought out with varied mechanics that aren't infuriating to play against. They're much less punishing than Dark Souls or Sekiro bosses because you can keep a fair amount of distance most of the time, though the arenas are a bit compact so you might spend an uncomfortable amount of time running away rather than shooting the boss. I don't remember how many of them there were off the top of my head, either three or four. Each one took me an attempt or two, but it didn't feel like a Dark Souls when you die a hundred times to try to defeat one boss with a two minute run back to the boss room each time, though loading screens are uncomfortably long if you make a habit of quickly chaining together deaths. They're pretty long in general though. Probably a tradeoff for those high resolution textures.

The English localization is................ A thing. The developer is Chinese, and just fired it off to some third-party to translate and localize. they didn't do a terrible job, but they also didn't do a great one. The translations themselves are actually somewhat okay, but sound a bit robotic and awkward in a few places. The voice acting is not inspiring. The girl who did Shelia gave a pretty solid though inconsistent effort, with everyone else being kind of robotic. It sounds like an anime dub circa 2005, or a modern Sentai dub. Fuckin' nailed 'em.

I actually played with the Japanese version for about fifteen minutes. That one is definitely better. You could also play with the original Chinese pack... I think. I don't remember if it's included or not.

# ............Story..............?

Ostensibly, this game has a story.

I don't want to brag or anything, but I'd fancy myself somewhat of a typical genius with an extraordinary ability to follow plots and predict story beats the likes of which mere mortals can only hope to even comprehend.

I have straight up no idea what the fuck happens in this game. It took me and my superior gaming abilities about two hours to finish the game, which means the "plot" happens at a pace that would make the SR-71 blush.

Now, for your edification, I shall attempt to explain the plot.

Ahem.

You play as Shelia, AKA Chinese Lara Croft, a member of the SRO, no idea what the fuck that is, who is sent to investigate a black hole that decides to suddenly exist in rural China and eat a mountain. You arrive on the scene, narrowly avoid an unoccupied cable car and crash into a mountain, forcing you to eject from your magic space plane and trudge towards the black hole on foot through villages occupied by some general dude's troops. You kill them all, but time has been ripped in two so occasionally you get sucked through the wormhole where you fight Chinese mythology like motherfucking Percy Jackson, then you fight a dude who wears a mask. Then you kill more soldiers because the dude with the mask lost the fight and decided to fuck off and pretend he won and challenges you to a duel somewhere else. Eventually you arrive somewhere else and fight him again, and after he loses again HE TURNS INTO A FUCKING CHIMERA MINOTAUR EAGLE LION GIANT THING AND STARTS ATTACKING YOU WITH A BALD EAGLE AMERICA FUCK YEAH AND HE THROWS SNAKES AT YOU NO NOT THE SNAKES AND FUCKING TACO BELL FALLS ON YOUR HEAD BONG. After defeating Exodia, the Forbidden One, using the power of the three Ancient God cards and the Pyramid of Light, you pick up the Phantom Hourglass which apparently is the only thing holding space and time together, although apparently doing a fucking shit job of it, when the evil general man that was in a cutscene an hour ago shoots you in the back straight through your left boob and picks up the hourglass you dropped, proclaiming that now he would become God after killing God even though you killed God to remake the world. Luckily, your intrepid sidekick who appeared all of two times and might actually be a sentient helicopter shows up and fires off some rockets and machine guns to distract everyone, allowing Shelia to tackle the general who drops the hourglass which shatters on the ground turning space and time into dust and broken glass.

Cut to black, wake up in your apartment where the game started but instead of talking about fireworks the people on the news are talking about an ancient mask that some archaeologists are digging up that is the same mask the guy who became Exodia was wearing.

That's it, I swear. The plot is an acid trip on cocaine in the middle of a heroin overdose where nothing is explained, but also there's just so nothing and you're being jerked back and forth constantly that it isn't even some kind of high-brow plot for literature majors. It's some kind of ambitious thriller mystery story... Thing that was reduced in scope by about 99% probably due to time and being the only developer on the project constraints.

There's some other stuff here that's weird. The cutscenes feel identical to Metal Gear Solid V cutscenes, but without facial animation and make marginally more sense (thanks, Kojima). Also it looks like he learned how to compose and frame shots by watching ecchi anime. Or any anime, really.

It's like if you took a "It's so bad it's good" Hollywood action B-movie, shortened the run time to 15 minutes, and then put Christopher Nolan in charge of it and told him to go nuts.

No clue what the fuck was up with the black hole. Someone check on Matthew McConaughey and see if he's still stuck in there.

# Conclusion

At $19.99, or almost $25 for all the absolutely necessary DLC outfits, or almost $30 for outfits plus soundtrack, should you buy this game with it's nonsensical plot and satisfying but rough around the edges gameplay? With a total runtime of maybe two hours and relatively limited repeatability unless you want to just keep doing New Game+ over and over, absolutely not.

At maybe $5 to $10, I would say the gameplay probably holds up pretty well if you're looking for a fast paced FPS title with some unique ideas. The visuals are pretty impressive, but not the greatest I've ever seen on the PC. Overall, the package is incredibly impressive given it's the work of one guy, but that comes with a number of inherent and very apparent disadvantages, mostly the incredibly poor story telling and short run time. It's somewhat hard to find a definitive confirmed source, but I think there's supposed to be additional "episodes" in the future to round out the story, but what we have here is so confusing and so nothing I'm not sure how you even build on it. It's like trying to build a house on a sand dune next to the beach on a pile of toothpicks.

Again, the gameplay is solid, and I guess I'd like to see more if only to give me more game to play rather than more story to... Uh... Enjoy.
