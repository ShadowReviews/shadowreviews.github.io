## _Booker, are you afraid of God?_

<br>

_Disclaimer: This review contains spoilers for BioShock Infinite. Duh. It's primarily a story driven game, and if you're ever going to play it, I would recommend doing so before this review. It's really good. You should go play it._

<br>

# Overview

Do you remember a time when video games didn't suck? I thought I did, too, however as the ravages of time have eaten away at my mind it seems as though, in fact, I had forgotten. Back in the day, whenever someone wanted to make a significant amount of money from a video game, the game actually had to be good. So if companies wanted to make massive amounts of money off video games, they had to make games that were actually worth buying and playing rather than making storefronts and casinos poorly disguised as entertainment. In my mind, BioShock Infinite was a critically acclaimed game that sort of came in right on the tail end of that, before the video game industry died forever.

I didn't end up playing it for another year or so when it was on Steam sale for like $10 or something, and I thought it was pretty good, but that was a long time ago. I decided to replay it, for no particular reason.

It's a lot better than I remembered. Now I'm just sad for the world.

# Story

In the interest of finishing this review before the decade is out, we're largely going to skip the story summary that often is included in a Shadow Review. Why? Because I don't have that much time. If we really get down in the weeds, we'll be here for the rest of my life, which hopefully isn't long.

From the moment the main menu fades to black and the game begins, you know BioShock Infinite is built a little different than other, more traditional (lesser) first-person shooters. While the screen is still pitch black, a woman's voice (Elizabeth) says "Booker, are you afraid of God?" to which Booker replies "No, but I'm afraid of you."

Then this text slowly fades in.

It's built a little different.

Of course, you don't know it right now but both of these will come up again much later in the story and with much greater significance. Foreshadowing and subtlety have seemingly become something of a lost art in the modern world of entertainment. If a writer decides to foreshadow something, they often make it so blatantly obvious that I'm not sure 'foreshadowing' is really an appropriate term, but they do so because people are stupid. Most people aren't really engaging their brains when watching a show or movie or when playing a game, so if you want to make sure that the greatest percentage of your audience possible "gets it," you basically have to ruin it.

BioShock Infinite does not give two shits about whether or not you're paying attention. The writers have decided that they're writing and if you're too slow or disengaged to catch on, that's your problem. As far as video game plots go, I think BioShock Infinite might be one of the more complex ones, however, I would say there are definitely more _complicated_ ones. Something I've come to realize is that complex and complicated can almost be two different things when referring to the plot of a story, even though it sounds like they should be the same or closely related. A complex plot can present themes or narratives that are more than the traditional good versus evil, or can have some kind of social commentary attached, which is largely what this game is. A complicated plot could be achieved just by adding shit tons of characters and lore that don't actually contribute to creating an engaging plot in any way, but I guess can create a richer universe. I guess what I'm getting at is the difference between lore and plot. Destiny and Destiny 2, I'm told, have good lore, but the plots are simplistic and boring. On the other hand, BioShock Infinite has a complex and rich plot, but you don't really learn of anything outside of the place you are in the moment in time (Uh....) at which events are occurring, which I suppose makes it a quite poor experience from a lore perspective. I'll take plot.

And boy does BioShock have it. Again, I'm somewhat hesitant to try and do an actual plot rundown, so here's the executive summary.

A guy called Booker DeWitt is sent to a place called Columbia to retrieve a girl by the name of Elizabeth for the purpose of clearing his extensive gambling debt. Booker locates the girl, some kind of science project, locked inside of a giant monument on the floating city from which he springs her. The two attempt to escape Columbia to Paris, but Booker is actually trying to take her to New York. That plan ends up not working out, some more things happen, they try to steal another airship, that doesn't work out, suddenly space and time are in tatters and now we're dealing with millions of different timelines.

That's why I really don't want to get into it, because if we really get into it there's no getting out. Elizabeth has a unique ability to open "tears" in the world, which she refers to several times as something between windows to somewhere else and a form of wish fulfillment. Fortunately, and unfortunately, it seems like the word tear is much more literal and she is quite literally tearing space and time apart. In one of her first tears she demonstrates to Booker, she opens it to Paris, and almost gets run over by an ambulance, which does not exist in the current year of 1912. Not only are the tears _somewhere_ else, they're also _somewhen_ else.

This becomes more and more evident later on in the plot as they start opening and entering tears in order to change certain events or revive certain dead individuals. There are more details scattered in that seemingly aren't that important until later on when they are, most notably that whenever they change timelines using a tear people who were killed and revived will have bloody noses. It also applies whenever there then exists two conflicting identities of a person, where there is some kind of knowledge that they should have given previous events of the timeline that they don't have because they jumped through the timeline. As those disparate identities sort of merge, their nose starts bleeding. That was a dogshit explanation but the bloody nose becomes a point of somewhat major conflict at the end of the game as everything really starts to get fucky when it's revealed that Booker is, in fact, the games main antagonist and also Elizabeth's father.

You see, Booker actually sold Elizabeth to Robert Lutece, one of the Lutece twins who are reoccurring characters in the story that basically serve to make everything fucky. But since things are already fucky by this point, it turns out that there are two versions of Booker DeWitt, Booker DeWitt and Zachary Comstock, the antagonist of the game who fancies himself a prophet with revelations from God and the supreme leader of Columbia. Early in his life, Booker was involved in the Wounded Knee Massacre, which leaves him with severe PTSD, causing him to basically spiral out of control. Shortly after the massacre, an event occurs which causes the timeline divergence. In a stream somewhere in the middle of the United States, Booker stumbles upon a preacher who offers to baptize him. If he accepts the baptism, he becomes Zachary Comstock, forms a cult, builds a great city in the sky, burns down New York with a fleet of airships and does all of the other bad things in the game, including trapping Elizabeth in a tower. If he rejects the baptism, he remains Booker DeWitt, goes on to eventually work as a Pinkerton, have a daughter, and sell that daughter to clear his debts.

Of course, since we're dealing with rips in space time and everything is fucky, both happen an infinite number of times. Comstock uses the tears to make his prophecies, which eventually renders him sterile, but since he can see into alternate realities, he knows that he has a daughter and wants her back, which is why he sends Robert Lutece to retrieve Elizabeth, actually Anna, from Booker DeWitt versions of himself that have a daughter. Ironically, Booker and Elizabeth running all around Columbia trying to kill Zachary Comstock is the quality father-daughter time that Comstock wanted but never got.

If you're confused, you should have listened to me and played the game like I said. If you did play the game and are still confused, well that's because this shit is really hard to explain. The plot is both complex and, towards the end, starts to get very complicated, but it does it very well and results in a confounding yet satisfying conclusion. Imagery is used quite well throughout the duration of the plot, especially towards the end when you're walking around a sea full of lighthouses under a starry sky where every star is another lighthouse wondering what the fuck is going on.

It's a really good game. As for the complex parts of the plot, well this game seems to have quite a lot to say, but without feeling the need to explicitly say anything with words. Columbia is supposed to be this grand city in the sky, as close to heaven as we'll ever get until judgment day, where the founding fathers of the United States are revered as some kind of prophets, and yet racial slavery is brutal. The first real plot point in the game occurs at the raffle where Booker pulls number 77, the winning number, so he wins the grand prize -- to throw a baseball at a mixed-race couple that's been chained up on the stage in front of some cardboard devil like creatures. At several points in the early game they'll walk through back rooms where signs will hang before exiting to customer facing areas that say "MIND YOUR MANNERS AMONGST YOUR BETTERS."

In the first timeline, there's a black woman named Daisy Fitzroy who allegedly killed Comstock's wife and is trying to lead something of a rebellion in the clouds, which eventually becomes successful later on in the game after jumping several timelines. Daisy's revolution triumphantly turns into war crimes, executing children, "anyone who gives us trouble," and "anyone wearing glasses." The revolution for equality quickly becomes genocide, with most of the rest of the game scattering civilian corpses around to indicate the consequences for citizens of Columbia who were unable to escape Daisy's Vox Populi after they came into some manner of power.

Beyond that, the religious messages that they preach are very much of the "REPENT SINNER" and "THE END IS NEAR" sort, where they believe themselves to be the righteous, pious, and holy people living in the clouds and everything else to be "the Sodom below" that will be burned away upon the Second Coming, but clearly they're not. There's also some other things thrown in, like some good old fashioned 1890's-esque oil tycoon shit where one man basically controls all the industry in the city, where poor (white and black) are forced to bid for jobs based on how quickly they can do them and for how low of a wage. Plenty of things that would probably be r/antiwork's wet dream.

The themes presented, coupled with an excellent setting and very well written plot all come together to make a fantastic experience. I've hardly even touched on characters, the two main ones being Booker and Elizabeth. Throughout the game it's clear that Booker has been failing to cope with severe PTSD from his time in the army as he constantly makes references to himself as being a bad person, but the writers never really feel the need to explain it, instead giving enough information for Elizabeth to figure out something, ask a question about it, and Booker to shut it down almost immediately. Elizabeth is a teenage girl who has been trapped in a tower alone for her whole life, so when somebody falls out of the sky and offers to break her out, she's both naive and hopeful, but also suspicious.

After their first engagement where Booker kills some police officers that were disguised to capture them as they attempted to buy airship tickets to Paris, Elizabeth runs away from Booker and is disgusted, calling him a monster for killing all of those people. Eventually, she accepts the fact that it's necessary if A) they're to survive and B) she wants to escape the city. Later on, however, Elizabeth kills Daisy Fitzroy in one of the final timelines where the revolution is successful because Daisy was about to kill a child. Elizabeth then proceeds to basically have a breakdown, which is good because the alternative character arc is "Oh no why did you kill those people oh well I guess I'm fine with this forever now." She's still not okay with it, clearly, and continues to change as the story goes on.

Comstock and Lady Comstock... That's a whole other thing entirely. Just go play the game. It's really fucking good. The plot is quite good, characters great, writing great, dialogue really good, voice acting great, music okay. It's a really good game. Just go play it. Stop reading this shitty review. The website is really good though.

## Gameplay

BioShock games aren't the greatest first-person shooters in existence mechanically. The gunplay is... Alright. It does feel like it's showing its age a little bit, especially given the baffling lack of an option for hold to aim on PC, the only thing available is toggle aim, even after nearly a decade. You can carry two weapons at a time, with about six to chose from, and then a slightly more different variant of one of the first six weapons later on in the game after the Vox uprising.

In addition to shooting, the player also has a number of Vigors at their disposal, analogous to the Plasmids found in previous BioShock games that have a variety of different effects. For the most part, I only used the fire grenade one, electricity, and the machine possession. For the most part I didn't find the others to be that useful for my playstyle. I played the game mostly with a carbine, a semi-automatic rifle, with occasional swaps over to my machine gun (which looks to be more of a submachine gun, but whatever) for close range engagements.

There's a few different enemy types, basically one that carries each of the weapon types, then has one of three degrees of armor, and also comes in red or blue depending on what side they're supposed to be on. There's also stationary turrets that shoot you on site that can be possessed to attack enemies using a Vigor. Additionally, there's automaton soldiers called Patriots that come in the shape of George Washington, Zachary Comstock, or Abraham Lincoln from the Vox. By the way, the people of Columbia view Lincoln as some kind of agent of the devil for freeing the slaves and John Wilkes Booth as a hero. The Patriots are sort of early game bosses, with large health bars and chain guns that do pretty significant DPS, but critical weaknesses on their backs that can down them in a few shots if you can get behind them.

Elizabeth is one of the first, and somehow only, video game companions that I would actually call a companion rather than a follower. Part of this is due to the linear nature of the game that allows the writers to integrated more impactful and consistent dialogue to build the relationship between her and Booker, but more than that she actually is useful unlike most video game allies. In Halo, Marines basically serve to occasionally carry weapons for you to rip off their corpses and to act as bullet shields for about the first two seconds of a level. In Skyrim, followers follow and attack things brainlessly. In BioShock Infinite, Elizabeth can open tears to provide cover, access to high ground via skyhooks, medkits, slats, weapons, turrets, and some other things. She'll also run around the battlefield to find ammo, medkits, and salts to throw to Booker when pressing the interact key in combat after she calls out that she has something. She doesn't do any fighting, but is more of a support character. She also picks locks. Most importantly, she interacts with you, the player, the story that is happening, and the world around her. She's a follower, and a companion, and a character in the story. In most other games you're lucky if you get one of the three.

There were a handful of bugs, towards the end of the game, somehow my character states got switched so I would be slow when walking, but then when I clicked the right mouse button to aim down sights my character would speed up and the sensitivity doubled which required a restart and set my back about ten minutes. There are also instances when using the skytrain system where the navigation aid will get confused and keep looping you around in circles. In general, the pathfinder on that could have used a little bit of work, because there's also plenty of occurrences where it will take you a much longer route, I also wished it projected a little further and lasted a little longer so I didn't have to constantly press 'N' to figure out where the fuck I'm going.

Another minor annoyance of mine is the Handymen. They're the sort of late-game minibosses that appear, and they're kind of just annoying. They jump at you and punch you, and also throw grenades, and can electrify the skytrain to prevent you from trying to cheese them. Their weakness is the heart on their chest, but it's almost impossible to hit because they're constantly jumping from across the map on top of your head, and the screen shakes _so much_ when they land near you that it's genuinely almost nauseating at times if you're actually trying to aim. I think all told you'll end up fighting about ten of them, but I generally found them to be un-fun engagements.

Speaking of engagements, there's really only one combat music track in the game which is designed to be more of a series of chaotic notes, with nice little musical flourishes whenever you get a headshot kill, but it does start to get repetitive the further you advance in the game.

Overall, the gameplay is solid, but the real star of the show here is the story. One of the things that really does not hold up well at all after the better part of a decade is the facial animations... Or the lack thereof. All of the NPCs have such cold, dead eyes that it's unsettling if they get too close to you and you stare into the void for too long. The rest of the animation is okay, but the faces just don't do it for me. Those cold dead eyes...

## Conclusion

BioShock Infinite game good. You should play game.

There's also some DLC that takes place in Rapture, the underwater city setting of the first two games. I think it's mostly unrelated to the actual game, and the actual game is so good that I almost don't even want to look at it, so I won't. I tried to play BioShock Remastered and honestly just never could get into it like I had remembered from BioShock Infinite at the time. BioShock Infinite was the first one I played. I think it's probably the best one. I don't have much else.

It is finished.
